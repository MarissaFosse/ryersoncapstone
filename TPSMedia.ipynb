It started early on Jan. 1, 2019, when a man was shot at Oakwood Avenue and Vaughan Road. He was rushed to a trauma centre and survived. And the violence continued until the last day of the year, with a double shooting near Jane Street and Finch Avenue West in the early hours of New Year’s Eve, and another man shot and killed in the evening. The two victims of the first shooting, both men, were rushed to hospital in serious condition. The victim of the second died in hospital after being shot in Scarborough at Neilson Road and Crow Trail, near Finch Avenue East. As of 9 p.m. on New Year’s Eve, 292 people had been  killed or injured in shootings in the city, 56 more than the previous year, which itself set a record for the most people shot in police data that goes back 15 years. Despite a more than 20 per cent increase in the number of shootings compared to 2018, this year saw seven fewer people killed by guns. Experts say that the combined total of injuries and deaths is a better measure of overall gun violence than fatal shootings alone, in part because whether a victim lives or dies can be decided by factors like health care, time of day or random chance. In an emailed statement, Courtney Glen, a spokesperson for Mayor John Tory, said the mayor continues to work closely with Toronto police to address gun and gang violence in the city, including funding for more front line and neighbourhood police officers in 2020, as well as more investment in communities to address the roots of violence. Tory “will continue to advocate for investments from the province and federal governments, while also calling for much tougher bail and sentencing laws when it comes to gun crimes,” Glen said. She added that the mayor plans to bring together the mayors of GTA municipalities, police chiefs and representatives from the provincial and federal governments to discuss “what else we can do across our region to address gun violence.” At his year-end news conference, dominated by the topic of gun violence, Toronto police Chief Mark Saunders emphasized the city’s policing needs are growing increasingly complex. In 2020, Toronto police will continue an approach they adopted during Project Community Space, a $4.5-million anti-gun violence project that wrapped after 15 weeks in late November. The project saw an increase in officer presence in strategic areas leading to hundreds of arrests, but ultimately did not result in a reduction in shootings. Saunders in particular emphasized that more “strategic” enforcement during the project had led to significant gun seizures. In the past, police “would blanket communities with officers,” which he acknowledged was divisive among some residents. This time they relied more on the guns and gangs and intelligence units to be “a lot more surgical.” Saunders said the spike in gun violence is partially attributed to the drug trade, particularly around the highly addictive opioid fentanyl, which he said has been a “game changer.” The city and police also led a gun buyback program, resulting in the surrender of 3,100 firearms, including 2,300 handguns, according to the mayor’s office. Accounting for population growth, the rate of gun violence in 2019 far exceeded even 2005, which was dubbed “the year of the gun” amid a record 51 gun homicides, the same total as 2018, which also set the city’s record for the most overall homicides, at 96. Forty-three men and one woman have been killed in shootings in Toronto in 2019.

Clinton Phil Williams, 43, was shot after walking into the parking lot at 100 Wingarden Court, near Neilson Road and Finch Avenue East just after 6 p.m., police said. First responders initially deemed his injuries serious but not life-threatening but later said Williams’ state had deteriorated and he died in hospital. A suspect fled in a light coloured car toward Crow Trail. He’s described as having a slim build, wearing black pants low on his hips, a black jacket with a hood or hoodie underneath and dark coloured running shoes, police said. Williams was the 44th person shot to death in 2019, the bloodiest year on record for overall gun violence in Toronto. Including him, 63 men and 12 women were killed in Toronto.

The vehicle took off and the police decided to give chase. Although they abandoned their pursuit, the car they were chasing hit another vehicle killing the 77-year-old driver and seriously injuring his 74-year-old wife. The driver of the vehicle being investigated fled the scene but was later arrested. After six months of investigating, Ontario’s police watchdog determined there are no reasonable grounds to lay criminal charges against the police. On June 22, at around 7:10 p.m., police officers were investigating a vehicle in a plaza parking lot in the Scarborough Golf Club Road and Lawrence Avenue East area, a report released Thursday from Ontario’s Special Investigations Unit states. Officers were investigating the vehicle because they observed the front-seat passenger wasn’t wearing a seatbelt, according to the report. As police officers got out of their cruiser, the vehicle accelerated and fled from the plaza. Police then pursued the vehicle. But they called off their pursuit as they entered onto Lawrence Avenue East because “there was plenty of traffic on the roadway,” the SIU report reads. “When the Honda accelerated away from the officers in the plaza parking lot, the (subject officer) pursued the vehicle for a short period but quickly disengaged, reasonably in my view, deactivating the cruiser’s emergency lights and siren,” SIU director Joseph Martino wrote in the report. “Given the circumstances, a full-blown police pursuit was unwarranted: there was plenty of traffic on the roadway, the subject offence was non-criminal in nature, and the Honda was well ahead of the cruiser.” But the vehicle they had been chasing ran a red light and struck another car in the intersection of Scarborough Golf Club Road and Lawrence Avenue East. “Regrettably, though the Honda driver had every opportunity to moderate his reckless driving, he chose to drive into an intersection on a red light causing death and serious injury to a husband and wife, respectively,” Martino wrote in the report. No one from the vehicle being investigated by police sustained serious injuries, according to a previous SIU report. “On this record, in the context of an extremely brief engagement between the cruiser and the Honda — under 30 seconds and about one kilometre — I am satisfied on reasonable grounds that the manner in which the (subject officer) operated the police cruiser fell well within the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law,” Martino said in the report. Initially, the SIU said five investigators, two forensic investigators and one collision reconstructionist were assigned to the incident. The offences being investigated were the dangerous operation of a vehicle causing bodily harm and dangerous operation causing death. “In the result, as the (subject officer) neither caused nor contributed to the collision between the Honda and the (victims’) vehicle in any manner that might attract criminal sanction, there is no basis for proceeding with charges in this case and the file is closed,” Martino said.

At the time, student attendance had plummeted following two shootings  within days of each other in the summer of 2008, she said. The route to the school went right past the scene of one of the homicides. “People were afraid to walk in the community and our kids weren’t going to school,” she said. That fall, Brackett hosted meetings at her home to marshal support for a common cause: public safety. It would lead to the creation of the Mornelle All-Stars Coalition, which started as supervised “safewalk” escorts to nearby Military Trail Public School and which has since expanded to include after-school homework help, a book club and March break and summer camps. The program is now credited with boosting student attendance and academic performance at the school, and, after partnering with Toronto police six years ago, has become the envy of other police divisions from Vancouver to Los Angeles. “The residents said ‘we’re taking our community back,’” Brackett said. Brackett and her fluorescent vest wearing civilian troops are well-respected by Mornelle Court residents and trusted by school staff who sometimes relay concerns about student attendance to Brackett. Attendance and academic performance has shot up for students supported by the coalition, said principal Sohail Shaikh, a Military Trail native. “The reason that it has been so impactful in our community is because they have expanded it,” Shaikh said. “It shows the power of what can happen when it starts within the community rather than outside agencies coming in.” Many parents, in the neighbourhood are new to Canada, working multiple jobs, which makes it difficult to walk their kids to school and provide necessary after-school reading and math supports, Shaikh said. Brackett’s team saw this need and with the support of Coun. Paul Ainslie convinced Toronto Community Housing to give them a vacant room in the basement of 90 Mornelle Crt., which they transformed into a hub with a kitchen, donated computers, and reading and writing material. The after-school program, which runs three days a week, averages about 30 to 40 kids, while the summer camps handle about 80 a day. “The kids (in Mornelle Court) are no longer idle during the summer because they’re still receiving education and recreational activities,” Shaikh said. “I would love for her to get extra resources to be able to offer it to more students in the area.” Coun. Paul Ainslie, whose ward covers Mornelle Court and several other blocks designated priority areas where poverty, racism and other factors put youth at risk, says residents from Tuxedo Court in his ward have been asking how they can replicate the program there. “At city hall, her group has been held up as an example of what you can do with community-based programming,” Ainslie said. During a recent school day, the hallways at Military Trail public were abuzz with excitement as 29 frolicking youngsters awaited their escort home. “It’s for our safety and all the volunteers are good people,” says Hadia Muheddia, 9. “It allows more kids to go to school if their parents are unable to take them.” Her friend Zamiah Anderson, 7, agreed. “It’s a good place for kids,” Anderson said. “We do homework and get free snacks.” Walking amongst the group is Const. Randall Arsenault, who’s ambushed by a jubilant crew of students. Six years ago, the coalition mended a once adversarial relationship with police. Arsenault had heard about the program and paid Brackett a visit. With the blessing of his supervisors at 43 Division, Arsenault started lending a hand. He has since gone from being a vilified outsider — having obscenities and even garbage hurled at him from balconies — to a neighbourhood fixture.

Known to make appearances at community events in his division, Arsenault’s work caught the eye of his superiors, who placed him in the role of community engagement officer, giving him the freedom to lend a hand on youth initiatives across the city. He is a big believer in spreading the word about his community work through social media, and is very active on Instagram and YouTube (40 YouTube post alone), with videos of him doing everything from providing advice to new officers to sitting down with community leaders and interacting with youth within 43 Division. In Mornelle Court, he walked the children home from school, helped with fundraising, and volunteered with the summer camp and after-school program. “From the start of the safewalk program there has been a drop in crime in the area,” he said. He said rather than building bridges with the community, he tried to make friends and that led to his success. “Police services (in L.A., Florida and Vancouver) are looking at this program and are asking about how to engage a community.” The affable officer was recently placed back on front-line duty, sparking outcry from Mornelle Court residents. Arsenault still visits on his own time. Arsenault’s changes in duty was done in part with Toronto police launching a new neighbourhood police initiative, where a handful of officers will be designated to do community engagement in certain divisions for a period of time. “I hope they have officers in there (Mornelle Court) for a few years at a time,” he said, adding it’s hard on the community when different officers fluctuate in and out. Another issue affecting the program is scarcity of funds. It depends heavily on donations from local businesses, churches and agencies. “We do a lot of things with donations and out of our own pockets to keep it going,” Brackett said. TCHC donated space for the hub and the city has provided some grant supports in past years, but Coun. Ainslie said it’s not nearly enough. “I get frustrated trying find them support,” Ainslie said. “We (city) have grant programs that they do one or two years and they expect people to be self-sustaining after that.” Brackett said a lack of funds won’t stop her troop of volunteers. In the throes of preparing grill cheese sandwiches for more than two dozen children in the after-school program, Brackett paused to reflect on how far the program has come in spite of the challenges. “We did it because we wanted to make our community safer and now it’s gone way beyond that,” she said.

Around noon Saturday, joggers discovered a black fabric luggage near a path of the Humber River Trail, by the Dundas Street bridge. Inside, they found a female Jack Russell-mix dog, alive, that had no collar or ID tag, police said. The dog was taken to a veterinarian to be checked over and is now in a shelter. Black Dog Rescue, a charity based in Toronto, posted about the discovery on Facebook on Sunday and said that joggers — supporters of the organization — were the ones who found the dog. “When they got close, the suitcase moved,” the post read. “They could hear a dog inside. They could tell the suitcase was thrown down the hill above where they found it. After climbing up the hill they were able to follow the suitcase’s drag marks 200 metres. It led them to the back of Lambton Arena’s parking lot.” The organization didn’t immediately respond to requests from the Star for comment. “Thankfully the weather was warmer than normal or she could have frozen to death,” the organization said in its post. “It was clear she had puppies recently. She was scanned for a microchip but didn’t have one. She is safe at Animal Services.” Mary Lou Leiher, of Toronto Animal Services, told the Star that her organization’s “priority is just to make sure that (the animals are) comfortable and that they’re healthy and as happy as possible. The dog seems fine, and we’re just making sure that (she’s) okay.” Leiher added that “if somebody wants to surrender their dog, they really don’t need to leave them in a suitcase in the park. There’s options for them,” including bringing them to Animal Services. People can also reach out to 311 if they find a lost pet. Police are hoping that someone recognizes the dog and has information about the incident. “Whoever did this to her needs to be brought to justice. She deserves no less,” the Black Dog Rescue group wrote. Get more of what matters in your inboxStart your morning with everything you need to know, and nothing you don't.

Public life happens every day throughout the building and I would never want to see that very special character lost.” But council has repeatedly been advised that security at the building needs to be improved, Matlow pointed out. “We don’t want city hall to become Fort Knox, but we do want it to be secure to protect the public and everyone who works here,” he added. “I wish things were different, but I also wish that I didn’t need to lock my front door every day.” The changes would restrict access to areas of the main floor at city hall that are currently open to the public. Access to councillors’ offices and council meetings is already restricted. To be allowed to attend a council meeting, visitors must submit to having their bags searched and walking through a metal detector. While details of the plan cannot be released for security reasons, Matlow said a blueprint is forming. The recommendations are based on assessments from Toronto Police Services, among other security-focused organizations. The estimated cost is $350,000 and is to be absorbed in the 2020 capital budget for corporate real estate management. The committee asked staff to report back in November on using artificial intelligence technology for the development of new and possibly less intrusive security methods. City council will have the final say. “I think it’s all very sad that it’s necessary,” said Coun. John Filion (Ward 18 Willowdale), who remembers the days when the mayor’s office wasn’t locked behind glass. That was before the deadly van attack on Yonge Street in 2018 that killed 10 people and injured 14, and before a gunman shot 15 people on the Danforth, killing two, and then turned the gun on himself.

The study, published last month in the journal “Race and Justice,” examined nearly 6,500 cases between 2007 to 2013 for differences in how a young person was treated on a first offence for simple drug possession or minor theft charges — the two most common offences faced by Canadian youth. Overall, Durham officers used their discretion to caution more than half of all young people facing these offences, while another 31 per cent were ordered to go to a formal youth diversion program, and thus also avoided court, and the remaining 15 per cent were charged. The fact the vast majority of youth were not charged is consistent with the principles of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, which seeks to limit formal court proceedings for young people caught for less serious offences, author Kanika Samuels-Wortley noted in her paper. But, she found, the outcomes varied with the race of the young accused. Black youth — who at the time of the study represented about six per cent of Durham Region’s youth population but 14 per cent of those caught for these offences — were charged in 19 per cent of cases, whereas white youth were charged in 16 per cent of cases and youth of all other racial groups were charged 17 per cent of the time. Officers did not record the youth’s race in more than 950 cases; that group was treated the most leniently, with only five per cent being charged. (The paper notes that if the “unknown” group matched the racial makeup of the region as a whole, more than 80 per cent white, then the charge rate for the “white” category would be expected to fall significantly.) In the paper, Samuels-Wortley, a PhD candidate in criminology at the University of Waterloo who worked for Durham police as a youth diversion co-ordinator, notes her findings are in keeping with similar studies and suggest that “race has a small but significant effect on police decisions.” The police service is not named in the paper, but its demographic data matches Durham Region. Durham police spokesperson Dave Selby confirmed the findings in an email to the Star, saying the service embraces the research. He added that police analysts have conducted an internal study on a newer set of case records from 2014 to 2018 that suggests the racial differences have since closed. That study found “no indication of disparity between Black and white youth with respect to the rate of charge or diversion,” he said. “Over the years, we have invested a ton of time and money into training front-line officers in terms of bias-free policing,” Selby said. “We continue to provide additional training and educational opportunities. We have a robust Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Strategy and continue to message this important information to all of our employees.” Selby said the service is “passionate about fairness, diversity and equity,” adding that “everyone has biases, including police officers, so it’s important to discuss this openly and to focus our coaching, mentoring and training efforts to recognize and eliminate any biases we uncover.” In the paper, Samuels-Wortley applauded the service for providing the data, saying it offered a “more nuanced” look at youth diversion programs than had been previously available. “This study would not have been possible without the commitment of a progressive forward-thinking police chief,” Samuels-Wortley told the Star.

Just that he was wearing brown loafers. The 65-year-old man whose shoes were left behind on Jarvis Street south of Gerrard Street East after he was hit Saturday night is still just a statistic. One more anonymous person killed in a hit-and-run on Toronto streets. The first of 2020. But not every victim is nameless. Just the next day, Peel police released the name and photo of 16-year-old Dianna Manan, who they say was left to die in a hit-and-run in Brampton early Sunday. The two cases and two different approaches highlight the questions of when and why police should release the identities of pedestrians and cyclists killed on city streets. Toronto police, for example, say they don’t release the identities of victims of fatal traffic collisions, as standard practice. South of the border, the New York Police Department regularly IDs road victims. And some advocates argue putting human faces on these deaths is an important step to getting the public — and politicians — to take them more seriously. Spokesperson Const. Danny Martini said Peel police made the decision in the Manan case for investigative purposes. “Just because there’s so little information to go off of, it’s just to get public awareness,” she said. It’s traditionally “case-by-case” whether to give out names of road victims, she said, “just because it’s so situational and every case presents so differently.” Peel police have guidelines on the issue, Martini added, but “it is something they’re looking at getting more structured wording on.” If anyone recognizes the teen, a Grade 11 student who loved music and art and wanted to be a pediatrician, they might have some information that could help the case, she added. And, “it makes it more real.” Spokesperson Const. Caroline de Kloet said Toronto police don’t release the names or road deaths as a “standard procedure,” unlike with homicide victims. But, on rare occasions, the service may also release an identity “for investigative purposes,” she said. “We don’t name them, we never do,” she said, adding she is not sure of the rationale for the practice. Of the 42 pedestrians and one cyclist killed in Toronto last year, by the Star’s count just a single victim was formally named by Toronto police, several days after her family had already identified her to the Star and other media. Celeste Jones, a 34-year-old beloved daughter and sister who loved books, film and television, was killed in August after a driver hit her as she crossed Sheppard Avenue East, and then fled. Her family kept a vigil over the spot where she was hit, hoping the person who left her would turn themselves in. In an interview with the Star, her father begged drivers to “be more humane.” The case is still unsolved. Releasing Jones’s name was “something that was done through Crime Stoppers,” de Kloet said, noting the group had made a video re-enactment of the crash. (In 2019, four of the city’s 42 pedestrian victims were killed while on foot on a 400-series highway, which are patrolled by the Ontario Provincial Police. Sgt. Kerry Schmidt said the OPP releases the names of these victims except in cases of suicide.) Last year was one of Toronto’s most deadly for pedestrian deaths in recent years, tied with 2018 for the highest since 2002, when 50 were killed. Several of the pedestrians killed were named by the Star or other media after reporters spoke with witnesses, friends and family. Their stories often made it to the front page and the city’s morning shows — but most victims were never identified. Those unnamed victims included people like the 76-year-old woman who was hit twice and killed while crossing a Scarborough crosswalk — by the drivers of both a turning transport truck and, minutes later, a car — around midday in August. Neither driver stayed with her. At least 25 of those pedestrians were over the age of 60. Many were killed on large suburban streets in areas such as Scarborough. In New York, NYPD spokesperson Sgt. Mary O’Donnell said that force releases the names and identities of any killed pedestrians and cyclists after notifying family as a matter of “public record,” just like Toronto police and others do for homicides.

Last summer, Toronto city council approved a beefed-up “version 2.0” of the plan, adding more red light cameras and reducing speed limits on some streets. Identifying victims is something Gil Penalosa, founder and chair of the non-profit 8 80 Cities would like to see become commonplace. It’s “very, very important” to release the names of all pedestrians and cyclists killed by drivers, he said. Following the 2018 Yonge St. van attack, in which a driver intentionally mowed down 26 pedestrians in North York, the names of the 10 killed victims were officially released by the provincial coroner and Toronto police a few days after the crime. (By that time, local media had already named many of the victims.) The stories of those victims, complete with relatable details of their lives, were widely published along with their photos. “So, all of a sudden, people realized it could have been me,” Penalosa said.

Koshin Yusuf was driving trucks six days a week while saving to start his own company, his 24-year-old sister Ilwaad said in an interview earlier this month. He had just finished a long day — he routinely worked 14 hours straight as a freelance trucker — and was walking into the Scarborough building where his family lives. Toronto police say two men armed with guns approached and fatally wounded him after Yusuf parked at 400 McCowan Rd. at 3 a.m. “He was literally just doing what he’s always done,” Ilwaad said. “My brother was the heart of my family. After losing his father at the age of 12, he became the father figure I and his two younger brothers needed,” she said. “Whoever took my brother from my family, they did not take his memory, nor did they diminish it.” Yusuf, who loved computers, gaming and designing things online, “was always sitting in front of a computer with headphones on,” and produced websites on the side, his sister said. He lived in Scarborough nearly his whole life, and spent 10 years at 400 McCowan, a Toronto Community Housing building that once had a bad reputation. The highrise north of Eglinton Avenue was home to the “400 Crew,” targeted by police raids in 2009. Since then, many families have moved in and people “don’t see much of the issues that the building used to have,” Ilwaad said. “I never felt unsafe” at 400 McCowan, she added, and neither did Koshin, because nothing bad ever happened to them there. Ilwaad said her brother recently moved elsewhere in Scarborough to be closer to work, but he was staying in the building while the rest of the family was on vacation. From 2013 to 2016, he taught English to more than 80 students while studying software engineering at Wuhan University in Hubei, China. But since he enjoyed driving, Yusuf decided to enter the trucking industry around 18 months ago, his sister said. Around 300 people were at Yusuf’s funeral service at Salaheddin Islamic Centre, a Scarborough mosque where the family is well known. “It just shows how loved he is,” said Ilwaad, who started a GoFundMe account to collect funds in her brother’s name. All the money will go to charity, either to support activities for underprivileged youth in Scarborough, or for projects in Ethiopia, the country the Yusufs hail from. There’s a severe drought in Ethiopia, and Yusuf once spoke of his desire to help provide water to people there, said Ilwaad. “He would want us to build wells.” Police, meanwhile, are asking for information about the shooting and any dashcam or security footage that might help the investigation.

Shane said he and his mother initially thought his uncle had some sort of accident and that the black marks they were seeing were stitches. However, upon closer look, he realized they were very wrong. Someone had drawn a swastika and a happy face on his uncle’s head in black marker. “I couldn’t believe my eyes,” Shane said. Shane said he questioned the staff member on duty who allegedly told him that this was one of two swastikas that were drawn on the 65-year-old’s body by “a younger man.” She then attempted to scrape off the swastika with her fingernail, Shane said. He said he was told that his uncle initially had a swastika drawn on his back, which was able to be washed off, but the one on his head was not. Shane said he then began to worry as to how a person could draw on his uncle’s body like that. “I was thinking: How did he get his shirt off? Why was his shirt off? Did this guy pull his shirt over his head and was abusing him?” Shane said, adding that he also noticed bruising on his uncle’s arms. On Thursday night, Toronto police released a statement, which said they received a call at 9:55 a.m. Monday. “It is alleged that a man used a marker to write on another man’s head and body, in addition to other acts which interfered with the lawful enjoyment of the premises,” the statement read. “The officers investigated and noted the markings were a few words and scribbles. No discernable images were found. Police are aware of an image of the man circulating on social media. This image shows what is believed to be a swastika on the man’s head. This marking was not visible to attending officers at the time of the original call. Today, the person responsible has been arrested. This matter is still under investigation and charges are pending.” Larry, who is living with Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and diabetes, has been a resident at Glendale, at 46 The Queensway, for approximately two years and is on a waitlist to get into a retirement home. The incident is “a private matter,” said a Glendale Care Centre staff member who answered the phone. The centre “cannot divulge any information at this time,” said the person, who wouldn’t provide their name to toronto.com.

But a close look at that budget, presented by staff on Friday, shows there are few programs set to receive new city funding that directly target youth violence through prevention or intervention programs — the kind experts say are desperately needed following a year in which the number of shootings reached a record high. Meanwhile, since council approved an anti-gun violence plan in July 2018 — a plan that remains largely unfunded, including in this latest budget — 51 young people aged 13 to 29, the target age of the city’s programs to address the root causes of violence, have been killed in Toronto. That is about one every 11 days. The category includes both victims of the city’s first two homicides of 2020: 21-year-old Ahmed Yakot, who was killed in a double shooting in Regent Park late on New Year’s Day, and 25-year-old Paul Anthony Desouza, who was killed in a shooting at a Scarborough townhouse complex on Saturday. “While the budget invests an additional $18.6 million in poverty reduction and addressing the roots of violence, I firmly believe that we must go further in investing in kids and families, especially as it relates to the threat posed by escalating gun violence,” Mayor John Tory said in a statement after the budget launch Friday. “In consultation with the budget chief and our council colleagues, I will be leading an effort to ensure that we find a way to make additional investments in kids and families and addressing the root causes of violence as the budget approval process proceeds.” That $18.6 million quoted by the mayor comes from a staff briefing note provided to the Star that compares the $8.4 million budgeted for 180 new police officers to the total of new investments in a wide range of programs that broadly fall under the banner of poverty reduction and the “root causes of violence.” It follows criticism that government spending has favoured police over funding to tackle problems that lead young people toward violence. But most of the programs and spending in the categories included in the $18.6-million figure are not the direct intervention strategies experts say will best address the problem, such as the ones staff recommended to council when it approved the anti-gun violence plan in 2018, to much fanfare. In fact, about half of the total cited by the mayor can be attributed to a $9-million seniors dental care program entirely funded by the provincial government. In the briefing note, staff concluded the proposed budget would see a two-to-one ratio in spending increases for community programs versus policing. The $18.6 million is a small fraction of the city’s $13.53 billion operating budget, which includes $12.1 million in new police spending as part of the Toronto Police Service’s proposed budget for 2020, which is more than $1 billion — one of the city’s single biggest line items. “While I am glad to see the rhetoric change about addressing violence at its core instead of always rushing to fund more police activities, I think the accounting presented may be a bit of a stretch,” said Coun. Mike Layton (Ward 11 University-Rosedale), who initially asked for staff to look at funding programs that address violence and poverty reduction at double the rate of the increase for the Toronto police. That comes after council made the anti-gun violence plan, totalling more than $50 million, entirely reliant on requests for funding from Ottawa and the province — requests which have been largely denied. Despite escalating gun violence, council has never moved to fund that staff-recommended plan in the absence of outside money. A total of $26.2 million in community interventions remain unfunded. The lack of funding has led to the reduction in 11 positions in the city’s social development division, budget documents showed Friday. One initiative, the TO WARDS Peace program — which would see experts and community partners intervene directly with youth living in priority areas to help avoid retaliatory and other violence — was put forward again by staff for $1.5 million funding this October, at the same time that Toronto police asked the city for $1.5 million to fund a 15-week anti-gang initiative called Project Community Space. But while council fully funded the police project, it committed to just $300,000 in start-up cash for TO WARDS Peace, telling staff to come back with a business case in the 2020 budget.

The staff-recommended budget is now asking the federal government to fund the remaining need for the TO WARDS Peace program at $1.2 million, as well as $275,000 to help the city’s crisis response team keep up with ongoing violence. After already rejecting the city’s earlier requests, Ottawa has not committed to either. The funding planned for expanding crisis response is now less than what was originally planned — the 2018 anti-gun violence grant request was more than $1 million annually. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal party promised an additional $250 million to cities to combat gun violence if elected — $50 million a year over five years. That funding is not guaranteed and it’s unclear how much would be available for Toronto.

The mayor’s office said it’s their understanding that both programs are funded in this budget, regardless of federal contributions. It’s not clear if additional city money is currently allocated to the programs in this budget. Nearly $1 million will be spent on four new, dedicated youth spaces in 2020, with a plan to build three more each in 2021 and 2022. Those dedicated spaces within existing city-run community and recreation centres provide mentorship, homework help, snacks and other programs for at-risk youth in neighbourhoods across the city. The money is largely needed for staffing. That investment comes after Coun. Josh Matlow (Ward 12 Toronto-St. Paul’s) pushed to double the number of available youth spaces during last year’s budget in response to ongoing and escalating violence — a proposal that was rejected by council last year. Matlow celebrated the funding for youth spaces on Friday. “I deeply appreciate Mayor Tory’s willingness to understand our arguments for youth spaces and that addressing the roots of youth violence makes our communities safer and can change lives,” Matlow told the Star. “This budget commitment will provide supportive environments, homework help, mentoring and access to mental health services to youth across our city.” The budget launch Friday is a the start of a month-long process that will see council make final spending decisions on Feb. 19.

We know every single one of their names. The same can not be said of the 42 pedestrians who were struck and killed by drivers in the city last year. We know that cars, SUVs, pickups, garbage trucks, construction vehicles, transport trucks and a TTC bus were involved. But, as for the victims themselves, the Toronto police formally identified just a single one. Even Toronto police don’t seem to have a good grasp of the rationale behind it. They should, and so should we all. In fact it may be time for Toronto to adopt a new policy of identifying the victims of traffic deaths after their families have been notified, just as is done for homicide victims. That’s what the Ontario Provincial Police does. And the NYPD in New York, a city that Toronto has already followed in adopting its Vision Zero plan, which aims to eventually eliminate pedestrian and cyclist deaths. We should move past this attitude of “oh well, accidents happen” that we’ve somehow adopted for deaths that involve vehicles. They aren’t natural occurrences and, for the most part, they’re preventable. That’s why the city, as part of Vision Zero, is redesigning roads, adding midblock crossings, reducing some speed limits, moving to photo radar in school and community zones, and increasing the number of red light cameras. On top of that, the city is ponying up $1 million to pay for a handful of police officers to actually focus on traffic enforcement. That’s something the Toronto force hasn’t bothered to do on its own since 2013 when it disbanded its dedicated traffic enforcement unit. Vision Zero initiatives could be enhanced and sped up. City council already knows that. Now it’s time for the police to look more closely at their role in making our roads safer. The police department’s casual treatment of traffic enforcement as a “supplemental role” to be done when the supposed real policing is finished isn’t working. Toronto police need to put more resources into traffic enforcement, given the increasing dangers on the streets and tragic death toll that now rivals gun deaths. And identifying victims of road deaths, just as the police do for homicide victims, is one more way to raise the profile of Toronto’s dangerous driving problem. It helps to humanize the victims. Without names (or faces and the stories of their lives that follow) the public knows these victims as anonymous statistics, not as people who tragically lost their lives. That does nothing to spur further political action or help change driving behaviour. Police in Peel Region, like Toronto, generally don’t identify road victims. They do it when it suits their needs, as they did last week in the case of 16-year-old Dianna Manan who was left to die in a hit-and-run in Brampton on Jan 5. The police released her name to help with their investigation. Knowing who she was increases “public awareness” and “makes it more real,” a Peel police spokesperson said. Indeed, Manan is no longer just a statistic. Along with a name and a face we know the Grade 11 student loved music and art and hoped to become a pediatrician. All road victims deserve to be made “real.” But of the 65-year-old man killed in a hit-and-run on Jarvis St. in Toronto, the day before Manan’s death, we still know nothing.

Zoia, 20, pleaded guilty in November to one count of mischief endangering life for the Feb. 9, 2019 incident that was recorded on a cellphone camera and widely distributed in a viral video that sparked public outrage. On Tuesday, Zoia came to Old City Hall court for what was expected be her sentencing hearing. A plain clothes Toronto police officer was also in court, carrying the Ikea chair itself, wrapped in plastic. But rather than hear submissions, Ontario Court Justice Mara Greene granted an adjournment until Feb. 7 at the request of Crown attorney Heather Keating. The prosecutor told court in a pre-sentence report prepared for the hearing that Zoia had told a probation officer — who wrote the report — that she did not post the infamous video to Snapchat last February. Keating said she thought it was an uncontested point. The Crown’s theory is that the Instagram model posted the video on Snapchat, and considers that an aggravating factor for the judge to consider when deciding whether to send Zoia to jail for six months, as the prosecution is recommending. Zoia’s lawyer, Greg Leslie, has suggested she receive a suspended sentence and probation. Keating told court she will call a witness at the Feb. 7 hearing to testify that Zoia did in fact post the video to Snapchat, a messaging app that lets users exchange pictures and videos that are meant to disappear after they’re viewed. But Leslie told reporters repeatedly that he will argue Zoia “did not post the video to Snapchat.” Asked if she posted it anywhere else, he stated the prosecution’s position is about Snapchat, and not any other online platform. Zoia, dressed all in black with monster sunglasses covering most of her face, appeared agitated during the brief proceedings, rushing to point out to a security officer that there were people in court using cameras to record her movements. Outside the building, Leslie said his client is “very anxious” and is having a difficult time. “She absolutely wants this to be over with,” he said. “The last thing she wanted to do was to have this adjourned, but at the same time she is not going to admit to something that she did not do.” Get more of what matters in your inboxStart your morning with everything you need to know, and nothing you don't.

Insp. Hank Idsinga of the Toronto police homicide unit confirmed to the Star this week that “after considering a number of factors that were uncovered during the investigation,” his detectives have determined the Shermans were murdered on the Wednesday. They were last seen alive in the early evening that day. Their bodies were not found until two days later. Idsinga would not reveal what the factors are that have allowed police and forensic officers to pinpoint the time of death, saying that to reveal detailed information about the case would jeopardize the homicide probe, now into its third year. Barry Sherman founded and owned the multibillion-dollar generic drug firm Apotex. He and his wife, Honey, were well-known philanthropists, donating money to large charities and also providing financial assistance to family and friends. Their date and time of death have been a mystery, as with many aspects of the case. According to friends, business associates and family, the Shermans concluded a meeting at Apotex to discuss construction of their new home at 6:30 p.m. that Wednesday. Honey headed home, stopping to pick up Hanukkah gifts for her grandchildren. Barry stayed at Apotex and sent a last work email of the day to colleagues, including one of his lawyers, at 8:13 p.m. from his work computer, then headed home. Both Shermans were likely home by 9 p.m. During most of the investigation, police documents filed in court have stated that the Shermans were murdered “on or about Friday, Dec. 15, 2017.” Their bodies were discovered late in the morning that Friday by a real estate agent touring clients through the house, which was for sale. Something — homicide detectives will not say what — has caused them to pinpoint the time of death as between the time the Shermans arrived home and midnight on Wednesday, Dec. 13. Their bodies were in a seated position in their basement swimming pool room, held upright by belts around their necks attached to a low railing. Forensic sources have told the Star that it would be difficult to pinpoint a time of death two days later, given that the bodies were found in a humid environment. Previously, the Star has reported that Honey’s cellphone was discovered in a powder room at the front of the house that her girlfriends say she never used. Barry’s winter gloves and a home inspection report he had promised to bring home were found in a basement hallway, just outside the door exiting the parking garage where his car was later found. The Star has also learned new details about the Shermans’ plans for that week. According to friends and family it was a typical week filled with the hustle and bustle of a busy couple. It was Hanukkah, and emails exchanged between Honey, Barry and their daughter Alexandra Krawczyk show plans for a get-together were being discussed. At one point, the get-together was suggested for the Wednesday night. Beginning on the afternoon of Saturday, Dec. 9, Alexandra emailed her parents: “Hi mom and dad, Would you like to come over on Tuesday or Wednesday evening? We can light the Hannukah candles and maybe you can bring us some egg-free latkas?” Alexandra and her husband, Brad, have two children, one of them a newborn at the time. The “egg-free” suggestion relates to their first child, who has a food allergy. On the email chain is Honey, Barry, Brad and Alexandra. The next day, Honey emailed the same group, saying: “Both work for me. Barry? Xoxo.” Then on Monday, Dec. 11, Alexandra emailed the group, suggesting: “Can we say tomorrow? (Tuesday)?” The next day, Barry emailed the group, acknowledging his daughter’s suggestion with a simple “ok.” With plans set for a Tuesday dinner at Alexandra and Brad’s house, Honey emailed the group Tuesday afternoon suggesting a new plan: “cld we have channukah on fri? just found some eggless recipes for latkas on the net — cldnt figure out where to find recipes before — cld make them fri in order to celebrate — cld also drop by tues or tomorrow wed — but without latkas — pls let all know what you prefer — also — what shld we do re (a child’s name) re gifts — I have one gift I know he will like — any suggestions? xoxo.” RELATED STORIESCanadaHow the private investigation by the family of Barry and Honey Sherman began and endedDec. 16, 2019InvestigationsBarry and Honey Sherman’s bodies were found posed like the sculptures in their basementDec. 12, 2019CanadaWatch the video: What happened inside Barry and Honey Sherman’s home before they were murderedDec. 13, 2019 Honey responds a few minutes later, “no problem — any gift suggestions?????? have a clear ball that lights up when you bounce it.” Alexandra responds, saying: “Wow!

We cooperated with the police (and) have been impressed with their determination to bring those responsible to justice.” A Sûreté du Québec police spokesperson said the case involves dozens of victims and investigators in Canada and the U.S. regarding a “SIM swapping” scheme. While Don Tapscott and his son Alex said they fended off the attack, Lt. Hugo Fournier of the SQ in Montreal said thieves netted $50-million in the U.S. and another $300,000 in Canada. Fournier said the SQ worked with Toronto police on the investigation, in which a Montreal teen was charged with four fraud-related crimes in the GTA. Toronto police declined to comment on the case. SIM swapping involves tricking a target’s mobile carrier into transferring a wireless service over to a device in the criminal’s control. Fraudsters use it to gain access to a target’s email, social media and financial accounts. Cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, are decentralized, internet-based currencies which are not controlled by any central authority. Most cryptocurrencies are based on a system called blockchain, which tallies and verifies transactions in an ever-growing online record. The father-son team of Don and Alex Tapscott are the co-authors of “Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin Is Changing Money, Business, and the World.” Don Tapscott said via email that businesses and individuals need to be vigilant with their cybersecurity. “This kind of criminal activity is far more prevalent than most companies and citizens are aware, and everyone should take heed to protect themselves as we have,” Don Tapscott said. The Ontario Provincial Police sent out an alert regarding the SIM swap scam in November, warning that fraudsters sometimes impersonate a target and lie that their phone has been lost or stolen.

The bodies were discovered roughly 36 hours after the murders by a real estate agent touring people through the house on Old Colony Road in Toronto. For two years, the Star has investigated. Part of the paper’s investigation has included arguing in court to unseal at least some of the police documents filed in support of search warrants and production orders. While the majority of the information remains sealed (Justice Leslie Pringle has said to release the information would jeopardize the case), the Star’s attendance in court every six months — four times in two years — has yielded information on the progress of the investigation. A Star reporter has on three occasions cross-examined homicide unit Det. Const. Dennis Yim, who is the only officer assigned full-time to the case. Two others are working on it, though they are assigned to other cases as well. In a statement from homicide Insp. Hank Idsinga on Thursday, the Star was told that the relatively few interviews conducted in recent months is not necessarily indicative of the status of the probe. “Interviews are only one component of any investigation and whether or not they are happening with the same frequency is not a reflection on the current status. With respect to the Sherman case, we would consider this investigation to be very active and while no one can predict what might happen tomorrow, to say it is in its final stages is not accurate,” Idsinga said in the statement. There are clues into how the investigation has progressed in the numerical information provided during this court process. By March 12, 2018, three months in, homicide detectives had identified 240 “witnesses” and interviewed most of them. Police use the term “witness” to describe any person with information about a case (not just someone who has seen something). Just over a year later, in April 2019, that number had grown only slightly, to 243. By October 2019, the number had again grown slightly, to 250. Confusingly, when Idsinga addressed the media in mid-December, he put the number of witnesses at 243, the same number Yim gave in October. Regardless of the discrepancy — Idsinga explained this week that “things are changing daily” in the probe — it is clear from the court record that almost all of the interviews were done in the first three months. Those people include Sherman friends, businesss associates, some family members, the private pathologist who made the double murder diagnosis and others. Intriguingly, two people interviewed in the initial flurry were re-interviewed last summer because they brought forward new information to police. Court has also heard that there are people (no number or names were given) who have elected not to speak to the police. According to police, one focus has been reviewing four terabytes of video surveillance obtained in the first week of the investigation. That equates to roughly 2,000 hours of recordings (an approximate number because lower-quality video uses less storage, so it could be up to 4,000 hours). The video comes from home surveillance cameras near the Sherman house (the Shermans did not have their own cameras), from traffic cameras on highways (such as highways 400 and 401, possible routes Barry and Honey would have used to get home), and from Apotex’s own cameras. The Star has previously reported that although video was seized from a home across from the Shermans’ and Apotex in the first few days of the probe, police did not view it until weeks later — when the case was officially deemed a double homicide. Other numbers show that by using search warrants and other means, police seized “150 items” in the first week and sent them for forensic testing. That number has not changed in over two years. The number of “judicial authorizations” had grown from 18 in the first few months to 38 by last October. No new judicial authorizations have been obtained since then, at least not as of mid-December when Idsinga updated the media. Judicial authorizations are requests for either search warrants (to go into a property, storage locker, etc.) or production orders — these are typically requests to obtain things like video surveillance, banking information and cellular phone or GPS tracking records. The majority of the court-approved searches have been production orders. What police described in October as a “voluminous” amount of data was obtained in May 2019 and by early September civilian analysts with the Toronto police intelligence unit had provided a report on its analysis of the data. Asked if it was GPS or cellular phone data, or something else, police would not say. Toronto police also have released a category called “investigative actions.” These are jobs detectives have to do — obtain a document, talk to a person, review previously obtained material. There were 474 in the first three months of the investigation, and as of last October there were a total of 709 investigative actions over the life of the probe. Yim told court in October that 56 were still to be completed.

At the press conference, Idsinga asked for anyone who sent one of 343 tips directly to the now-defunct Sherman private investigation team to resubmit them to police, to make sure nothing was missed. “I anticipate the next several weeks are going to be very, very busy going through a lot of information,” Idsinga said on Dec. 16. “We’ve been getting a lot of great information from a lot of different sources and … I anticipate we’re going to be getting a lot more information.” On the issue of whether the police have a suspect or suspects, they refuse to say. In court last October, a Star reporter questioned Yim, asking why he would not say if there was a suspect or suspects, or a person of interest (someone who is not a suspect but may later fall into that category). “If I speak in a general term I might be able to explain that,” Yim told court. “If in a case there’s only one perpetrator and that perpetrator knows that he is the only one, if I answer that we have a person of interest or we have a suspect, then that may alert the perpetrator that the police are onto him. And that’s why when you ask me that question, I’m reluctant to answer.” Yim explained that when a production order is served, the “entity” that receives it (a bank or a telecommunications company, for example) is barred by a court order from revealing to the individual that a search was carried out.

Toronto Fire Services were called to a fire at 824 St. Clair Ave. W on Dec. 16 at about 3:30 p.m. The fire truck was travelling north on Oakwood Avenue, with lights and sirens activated, police said in a news release Friday. As the fire truck approached Rosemount Avenue, which is controlled by a pedestrian crossover, the driver passed a stopped vehicle and struck the girl as she walked west in the crosswalk, according to a Toronto police news release. Toronto Fire Services immediately performed first aid on the girl and she was taken to hospital with serious, but non-life threatening injuries. The girl is still recovering in the hospital. The driver of the fire truck has been charged with careless driving resulting in bodily harm and for overtaking a stopped vehicle at a crossover. Both charges are Highway Traffic Act offences. Although there are exemptions for emergency service vehicles when it comes to speeding and proceeding through red lights, there is no exemption for pedestrian crossovers, police spokesperson Meaghan Gray said. “In this case, we are alleging that the fire truck failed to stop at the pedestrian crossover,” Gray told the Star. Toronto Fire Chief Matthew Pegg said Toronto Fire Services continues to co-operate fully with the police through their investigation. “Toronto Fire Services is also conducting its own internal investigation in an effort to ensure such incidents do not happen again,” Pegg said in a statement. The firefighter who has been charged remains on active duty, Pegg said. “He is a highly trained and experienced firefighter with more than 22 years of service with Toronto Fire Services,” Pegg said. “My thoughts, and the thoughts of the entire Toronto Fire Services team, are with the young girl and her family during this difficult time,” he said. Toronto police did not give the name of the firefighter. In a statement, police said that they do not provide names of people charged under the Highway Traffic Act. Pedestrian crossovers — button-operated crosswalks that are controlled by flashing yellow lights and box marked with a black “X” — are intended for low- to moderate-traffic volumes in areas with low speed limits. In 2018, city staff recommended the crossover at Oakwood Avenue and Rosemount Avenue be replaced with traffic lights, saying a standard traffic control signal would “provide a more appropriate form of crossing protection for pedestrians in this area.” Get more of what matters in your inboxStart your morning with everything you need to know, and nothing you don't.

Environment Canada said Toronto could see close to 15 centimetres in total. The snow was expected to taper off to wet flurries or light showers Saturday evening, as the temperature hovered above freezing. The city had been preparing for the snowfall for days before it hit, said spokesperson Eric Holmes. “We’ve got about 1,500 staff who have been on call for every storm like this,” said Holmes. Salt trucks were on the road at 7 a.m., while plows were dispatched once 2.5 centimetres of snow accumulated on major expressways and five centimetres on major roads. Neighbourhood streets were to follow, Holmes said. Clearing Toronto’s 9,500 streets is typically a 16-hour operation and residents are advised to wait before calling the city, he said. “If you haven’t seen a plow on your neighbourhood street after this kind of storm by Sunday afternoon then you can call 311, but our crews are going to be out all night working,” he said. Holmes urged Torontonians to stay off the roads Saturday night. Police had responded to 40 active collisions by 4 p.m., and a total of 250 collisions were reported in 24 hours as of 7 p.m., according to Sgt. Kerry Schmidt of the Ontario Provincial Police. “As quickly as we can clear them, new crashes are happening. Cars are spinning out of control, going sideways, getting stuck. I saw some vehicles having struggles even merging onto the highway,” Schmidt said in a video posted to his Twitter. Schmidt advised drivers to give plows “lots of space” to do their job and make sure full vehicle lighting systems were on because of reduced visibility. “The collisions that we have been dealing with right now have all been relatively minor in nature,” Schmidt said. “Mostly slow-speed collisions, but they are preventable and drivers are still going likely a little too fast.” The weather also affected TTC service. “We have a lot of vehicles on the road today and some of them have been caught in snow and slippery roads,” said spokesperson Stuart Green. Only one TTC vehicle had been involved in a collision and all routes remained in operation, Green said. “With the amount of snow we’ve seen today, we’ve seen a number of our buses get stuck on hills and steep inclines. We’ve had a couple of streetcar diversions, but they were related to on-street accidents as opposed to the weather per se,” Green said.

Cancellations were not expected to increase significantly overnight, but MacDonald said passengers should expect longer waits when boarding and disembarking, as crews worked to clear snow and ice.

The cause of death initially seemed to be fire-related. But Toronto police announced last week that Kudzianiuk was the city’s third murder victim of the year. A fire broke out shortly after 3 a.m. on Jan. 13 in an 18th-floor Scarborough apartment unit at 25 Bay Mills Blvd., near Sheppard Avenue East and Warden Avenue. Firefighters found the unit fully engulfed and extinguished the fire but found Kudzianiuk suffering from serious injuries. She was taken to hospital where she later died. An autopsy conducted Jan. 14 determined her death was the result of a murder. “She didn’t have any enemies. She didn’t have any lovers who could do that. She was the nicest person I knew, really,” Bedlitsky said of the woman he referred to as an aunt due to their close relationship. “People always say that, but I really put meaning to this word. I haven’t seen a person more sincere, open and kind.” Bedlitsky is in shock, as are Kudzianiuk’s family and friends, he said.

There was nothing “in the context of a criminalizing impact,” said Beverly Bain, a women and gender studies professor at the Mississauga campus. The 2016 National College Health Assessment found that 61 per cent of 25,000 post-secondary Ontario students surveyed experienced feeling hopelessness in the previous year, nearly half “felt so depressed it was difficult to function” and 13.2 per cent seriously considered suicide. Last week, the university accepted all of the recommendations by a 13-person task force consisting of students, faculty and staff that was convened in the spring of 2019. The task force’s job became more urgent in the fall after a student in the Mississauga campus spoke publicly about her debilitating experience of being handcuffed by campus police — as part of protocol — when she sought help from the campus nurse for having suicidal thoughts. She was not intoxicated or agitated or holding any weapons at the time. That student coming forward has led to several other students, primarily women of colour, “sharing their experiences of being handcuffed after seeking mental health support” on campus, according to an open letter signed by at least a dozen faculty to the university president and senior leaders in November. “As faculty and staff, we are trained to refer students to services … now we have to seriously consider whether such a referral could lead to further harm,” they wrote. They’re not alone in their concerns. In his 2014 review of Toronto Police Service policies and practices following the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Sammy Yatim, Justice Frank Iacobucci urged police to “identify exceptions to TPS requirements such as handcuffing … in recognition that the apprehension of a person in crisis under the Mental Health Act differs from other types of police apprehensions.” In its report, the University of Toronto task force said, “We recommend this practice (of handcuffing) be reviewed by the university and that a trauma-informed protocol … in their evaluation of the safety and risk of the student … be developed.” It’s true that handcuffing traumatizes already struggling students, but that isn’t all of it. Handcuffing isn’t just about health or support or safety. Steel handcuffs are universally associated with criminality. On TV shows, they’re usually produced when the bad guys are caught and being read their rights. They’re seen as a necessary restraint to protect society. In reality, handcuffs can be misused to protect institutions and even police themselves from liability. Writing in the Journal of Canadian Family Physician, three professors who work in university health care settings said even “sympathetic officers believe that they will not benefit from institutional support if they do not physically restrain patients during transfer and a negative outcome occurs.” Handcuffs can also be selectively used on already marginalized people. In an appalling incident at a Vancouver BMO bank in December, police handcuffed and arrested Maxwell Johnson and his 12-year-old granddaughter when they went to open a bank account and were deemed suspicious. Add to that, Johnson, whom the Heiltsuk First Nation said, is a “much-loved and respected artist, carver, cultural leader, singer, foster parent, and knowledge holder in our community,” suffers from anxiety and panic disorder. In 2016, a 6-year-old Black child was shackled — hands and feet — in her Peel district school, for the sin of kicking and punching, according to police, who said the handcuffing was in the interest of “safety of other students and, ultimately, the child.” The child had no known developmental issues, her mother told media.

You’re now seen as a threat in need to be constrained. It’s a carceral intervention.” Seen through the lens of criminality, the university cannot merely review handcuffing symptomatically, but consider the larger structural issue of whether police — campus police or municipal ones — should be involved in mental health intervention at all.

The Grade 10 student — shy and hard-working, but with a fun-loving streak — was on his short walk home, among a crowd of pedestrians at Ellesmere and Markham roads when, just after 3:10 p.m., gunfire rang out multiple times. Panicked students scrambled, one gunman fled the scene, and Khosrawi, just 15 years old, was left gravely injured. Rushed to hospital, the boy died a short time later. The shooting in broad daylight has stunned and devastated Khosrawi’s parents and three older brothers, upended his high school community, and resulted in second-degree murder charges against another 15-year-old boy who also attended Woburn Collegiate. “It’s devastating news that nobody should ever face in their life,” said Sha Fariad, a relative who had watched Khosrawi grow up and said Khosrawi’s father was originally from Afghanistan. Describing the boy as someone who “doesn’t fit the paradigm of today’s society,” Fariad said Khosrawi spent most of his time at home with his family — an introvert, but a youngster who could also be “a jolly kid.” As yet another teenager felled by a bullet, Khosrawi joins the growing ranks falling victim to Toronto’s increasing gun violence. Despite recent investments in policing aimed at combatting violent crime, the city has seen record-level gun violence: last year, 292 people had been killed or injured in shootings, the highest number in at least 15 years. Of the four people killed in the first weeks of 2020, three were shot and were 25 or younger. Whether Khosrawi was the intended target or an innocent bystander is too early to say. Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Det.-Sgt. Andy Singh said police were considering both possibilities, though he said it was “unlikely” it was a case of mistaken identity, in part because the shooting happened in broad daylight. Police are clear, however, that Khosrawi is “completely innocent.” “There’s nothing in his past to suggest he’d be in a situation like this,” Singh said. The alleged shooter, who cannot be identified because of his age, was known to police. The youth — who was apprehended nearby not long after the shooting — had gang ties, though Singh added it was too early to tell if this was a factor in the shooting. He said he didn’t believe the youth and victim were friends. Noting “many citizens” would have witnessed the shooting and its aftermath, Singh urged anyone with information, or video footage, to come forward to police or anonymously through CrimeStoppers. Police now conducting a “painstaking” review are looking into information another person may have been involved, though Singh stressed investigators had no indication that another shooter is involved. Among the questions police are now probing is whether the alleged gunman brought the weapon to school Monday. “The Woburn community will come together to show our respect and support based on the family’s wishes,” wrote principal Karen Hume in a letter to parents, saying the school was mourning the tragic loss. Khosrawi was a “conscientious and hard working student,” who Hume said would be “sorely missed by our students and staff.” Counsellors will be available to provide students and staff with support starting Wednesday. Khosrawi’s death has prompted calls for urgent action to address the causes of rising violence in the city. Last year alone, 43 men and one woman were killed by gun violence, and scores more were injured. At a year-end press conference last month, Toronto police chief Mark Saunders said there are now more firearms in the city, and he vowed to combat gang activity this year through greater use of force’s intelligence and guns and gangs units. Since the beginning of 2014, 186 young people aged 13 to 29 — the age the city targets for violence prevention programs — have been killed in Toronto. That works out, on average, to about one young person killed every 12 days. Nearly a quarter of those people killed, 20 per cent, were teenagers. The numbers do not include killings believed to be domestic. In a statement Tuesday, Mayor John Tory said the murder of a 15-year-old in Toronto “is tragic and completely unacceptable.” Get more of what matters in your inboxStart your morning with everything you need to know, and nothing you don't.

Earlier this year, following a spate of summertime shootings, Tory announced that municipal, provincial and federal governments would each pledge $1.5 million to Toronto police “to help fund immediate efforts to address the current gun violence.” Using the money, the force initiated a 15-week guns and gangs initiative that saw increase enforcement in “high-risk areas.” But ultimately, it did not result in a reduction in gun violence. “This is about two 15-year-olds who should never have been in this situation in the first place. We need to address the roots of youth violence,” said Coun. Josh Matlow (Ward 12 Toronto-St. Paul’s). “We need to provide opportunities to our youth as early as possible so that we can provide them a path that any one of us would want for our own children. This didn’t need to happen.” Matlow pushed to implement a Toronto strategy to address the roots of youth violence in 2014 and has asked council to fund additional safe spaces for youth after school in recent budgets. He said there’s much more to be done, and that all levels of government are responsible.

There’s so much more that we can do.” In July 2018, amid escalating violence that summer, council approved an anti-gun violence plan totalling more than $50 million. To date, much of that plan remains unfunded, including about $25 million in community-based initiatives designed by city staff to intervene with youth in conflict and prevent violence from happening in the first place. After the federal government rejected most of the city’s requests for money for those programs, council has not found new funding to implement the plan. Coun. Paul Ainslie (Ward 24 Scarborough-Guildwood), who represents the Markham and Ellesmere roads area, said he was stunned by the news. “It’s just a senseless tragedy. It’s mind-numbing. It’s still mind numbing for me,” Ainslie told the Star. He said school-aged kids used to more commonly solve conflicts with fistfights. “Now they’re stabbing each other and shooting and I don’t know what the root cause of it is . . . Kids just don’t seem to have a respect for life like they should. “I don’t think you could ever have enough youth hubs to deal with that and I honestly don’t know where the solution lies.” A GoFund Me page to help pay for funeral expenses has been organized by family.

Seven teens were murdered in Toronto last year. Aseel Yehya, 18, was shot on Elmhurst Dr. near Redwater Dr. in Etobicoke on Jan. 9, 2019, after police said a dark-coloured vehicle approached him and gunshots were heard. According to police, Yehya attempted to run away but was shot. The driver fled. Yehya’s former teacher, Ross Murray, said he would remember him as a promising and well-liked young man. He was a talented musician who was developing a reputation as a gifted singer and writer of rap lyrics, Murray said. Nicklus McKain, 18, was shot near Kipling Ave. and Albion Rd. in Rexdale on Feb. 24. He died in hospital. Police said a 19-year-old man was also shot and seriously injured but survived. In February, police appealed to anyone with dash-cam video who was travelling in the area between the hours of 1:45 p.m. to 2:15 p.m. that day. Brendon Bowler, 17, was stabbed near Sir Wilfrid Laurier C.I. high school near Guildwood Pkwy. and Livingston Rd. on May 6. Emmett Carew, 18, and Cheddi Itwaroo, 20, both of Toronto, were charged with second-degree murder. Bowler was a student at the high school, Toronto District School Board spokesperson Ryan Bird confirmed to the Star at the time. Jaydin Simpson, 17, was shot in a parking lot near Danzig St. and Morningside Ave. in Scarborough on June 28. Known as Juicy J to friends, he was described as sweet and sunny, and was one of seven siblings. He was a recent graduate of Sir Wilfrid Laurier Collegiate Institute, loved basketball, and planned on attending George Brown College. “He was such a good boy, a good son, kind to everyone, go out of his way to help people,” said his father, Chris Elliott. Hanad Abdullahi Ali, 16, was shot at Falstaff Ave. near Jane St. around 1 a.m. on Aug. 1. “I don’t know why they killed my son. They killed an innocent child,” his mother, Hodan Abdullahi Ali, told the Star. “He loved his brothers. He listened to me. He loved to play,” she said. At a meeting following his death, members of a community around a trio of Toronto Community Housing buildings on Falstaff Ave. expressed disappointment at how police and security organizations have treated them in the past. Matthew Dreaver, 16, was deliberately run down by a driver near East York Memorial Arena on Oct. 7 at about 2 a.m. Police say Dreaver and a 14-year-old friend were hanging out near the corner of Woodbine Ave. and O’Connor Dr. when they got into an altercation with two men in a parked SUV. The men first pursued the two boys on foot, then in the SUV. The driver of the SUV mounted the curb and intentionally ran over Dreaver as he fled toward a community centre, according to police. They later released graphic footage of the incident in an attempt to help catch the driver. Firdous Nabizada, 19, of Toronto, was stabbed at a party at a fraternity house in the Annex, near the University of Toronto’s downtown campus, on Halloween. He died in hospital two days later. Jacob Alves, 19, of no fixed address, and a 15-year-old girl from Richmond Hill were each charged with three counts of aggravated assault, three counts of assault with a weapon, possession of a weapon for dangerous purposes and attempted murder. Alves’s charges were upgraded to second-degree murder after Nabizada died. Nabizada was humble, hard-working and a talented soccer player who dreamed of going pro, according to friends. He “had big dreams” said Basir Ghousi, 26, who used to play soccer with him. “He was a young guy. He shouldn’t have gone.” RELATED STORIESGTAKilling of ‘completely innocent’ 15-year-old boy near Woburn high school leaves family devastated, community mourningJan. 21, 2020', 'https://www.thestar.com/politics/provincial/2020/01/21/ontarios-human-rights-watchdog-made-a-shortlist-for-new-commissioners-doug-ford-picked-two-of-his-own-instead.html': \"Premier Doug Ford has quietly appointed a Toronto police officer and a professor with Progressive Conservative links to sit on the Ontario Human Rights Commission, the Star has learned. Const. Randall Arsenault — a 19-year police veteran with Indigenous roots and a sizable following on social media, where he has lauded Ford — and Violetta Igneski, a McMaster University associate professor in philosophy, were chosen to fill two commissioner positions. The human rights commission was caught off-guard by the political appointments, which were made on Jan. 14 but have yet to be officially announced. They come amidst the rights watchdog’s ongoing inquiry into allegations of racial profiling and discrimination against the Toronto Police Service, raising questions around the optics and timing — and the potential for conflict of interest. Neither Arsenault nor Igneski were among about 330 applicants for commissioners’ posts submitted for vetting to Renu Mandhane, Ontario’s chief commissioner of human rights. Mandhane told the Star she came up with a short list of about 30 candidates late last year, under what she believed was a process to which the Ministry of the Attorney General had agreed. “I didn’t receive their applications as part of the package that was sent to me by the public appointments secretariat,” she said. “I don’t know if they applied, but I didn’t receive their applications.” The commission is seeking clarification from Attorney General Doug Downey about how the appointments came about. “Obviously, we were in the middle of a process that I thought we had agreed upon, so I was somewhat surprised to hear about the appointment of the two new commissioners,” said Mandhane. She said she was “concerned” that a Toronto police officer on active duty had been appointed while the commission is conducting its inquiry. In a written statement, Downey’s office said Arsenault and Igneski were named “to support and advance the commission’s mandate to provide leadership for the promotion, protection and advancement of human rights, and builds partnerships across the human rights system. “The appointments were made in accordance with the Ontario Human Rights Code,” the statement said, referring to the necessity for commissioners to “have knowledge, experience or training with respect to human rights law and issues.” Downey’s office emphasized that it is Mandhane’s responsibility “to manage potential conflicts between commissioners and their duties” as members of the human rights commission. Since becoming premier in June 2018, Ford has shown little interest in the commission. While Mandhane’s term as chief commissioner extends until October, all nine of the other commissioners’ terms had been allowed to expire before last week’s appointments. Last January, CBC News reported that University of Toronto psychology professor Jordan Peterson was granted a private audience with the premier a week after tweeting, “The faster the Ontario Human Rights Commission is abolished, the better @fordnation.” Peterson, who has 1.4 million Twitter followers, is internationally famous for his pointed critiques of political correctness. His tweet, which also referred to the commission as “a dangerous organization,” followed an interview Mandhane gave to CBC Radio’s Metro Morning. At the time, the Tories were unhappy the commission had joined a legal challenge of Ford’s decision to temporarily replace the 2013 sex-education curriculum with a lesson plan from 1998. A modernized curriculum was reinstated last year. Arsenault, an Aboriginal liaison officer with Toronto police, has 31,000 followers on Twitter and 53,000 on Instagram, where he frequently posts selfies, messages and videos. He also recently helped save two men from drowning.

Arsenault wrote in the caption that police officers “have been taking photos with politicians in all levels of government and all political parties for quite some time now. I was proud to stand beside our Premier Doug Ford.” Igneski is related to Jasmine Igneski, who has worked with the federal and provincial Conservatives. A research paper by Igneski thanks family for their support, and specifically a sister named Jasmine. Jasmine Igneski served as a policy adviser to prime minister Stephen Harper. She was also a senior policy adviser to Mike Harris’s Progressive Conservative government. The Star left messages with Arsenault and Igneski seeking comment Tuesday, but did not hear back from them. Toronto police spokesperson Meaghan Gray said Arsenault’s many years of service and “experience as a community-builder, youth mentor and Aboriginal liaison officer in his division will make him a valuable asset to the OHRC and his experiences with the commission can only translate positively for the TPS.” As for his attendance at Ford Fest, Gray said both Arsenault and his partner were on duty and had permission to go. While the government is entitled to make the appointments, they come on the heels of controversy last summer over a series of political appointments linked to Ford’s former chief of staff, Dean French, and a promise by the premier to clean up patronage. Commissioners are part-time and receive per diem compensation for their work. On average, each commissioner is expected to work two days a month and make no more than $10,000 per year. “My priorities for the commission are non-partisan appointees, people with deep human rights expertise, including lived experience,” said Mandhane.\", 'https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2020/01/21/new-member-of-toronto-police-services-board-is-a-big-proponent-of-community-policing.html': \"After he becomes the newest member of the Toronto police board, Ainsworth Morgan plans to spend a good while just listening — a skill he has honed over two decades as an educator. “I think it’s important to be a good listener, to recognize that these are issues that are not necessarily easy and there are some difficult challenges that are ahead,” Ainsworth said in an interview this week. Morgan, the principal at the Toronto District School Board’s Pelmo Park Public School, will be sworn in Wednesday to a three-year provincial appointment as the civilian police board’s seventh member. He replaces Ken Jeffers, whose term ended in November. Raised in Regent Park, Morgan studied criminology in United States before playing professional football, including two years with the Toronto Argonauts. He then turned to education, including a stint at his own former elementary school in Regent Park, now known as Nelson Mandela Park Public School. He says 20 years in education have taught him how to work with people who have a diversity of opinions, a skill he says will serve him well on the police board, particularly during public meetings. The board’s monthly meetings often include heated debate and protests, which sometimes force them to recess or end prematurely. In July, a group of demonstrators disrupted a meeting to protest what they said was a lack of swift action following the allegation that Black teen Dafonte Miller had been assaulted by off-duty Toronto police officer Michael Theriault and his brother, Christian. The Theriault brothers are currently on trial in Oshawa. Asked how he will handle arguments and confrontations as a board member, Morgan said the protests show there is “obviously passion about the issues.” The solution lies in getting “to the root of where that passion is coming from” and finding common ground, Morgan said. Calling himself a “big proponent of community policing,” Morgan said he is particularly interested in helping build positive relationships between youth and police. On a “selfish level,” the father of three — his sons are 20 and 16, his daughter turns 14 on Wednesday — Morgan said he is concerned for his children, as well as for those in his school. He is worried about both the rising levels of violence in the city — which saw a record number of shootings in 2019 — and negative interactions between officers and youth.

Forcillo, 37, was granted day parole in August 2019 and was allowed to move to a halfway house. He became eligible for full parole this month. The board found that he did not breach any of his release conditions while on day parole and has transitioned well to community living, with strong family and community support. “This is to your credit and reflective of an offender with high levels of motivation, accountability and reintegration potential,” the board wrote in the decision, which was based on a paper review of Forcillo’s file. Forcillo is currently in a full-time college program, where he is training to become an electrician. He was assessed by a psychologist as one of his day parole release conditions, and was found not to require ongoing treatment. Ed Upenieks, the lawyer representing Bill Yatim, Sammy’s father, said the family is unhappy they weren’t given advance notice of the parole decision. The first they learned of it was from a reporter calling for comment. “A family in a situation like this shouldn’t be finding out from the media,” Upenieks said. “Why was the family in the dark?” he asked, adding that Bill Yatim has completed the registration forms with the parole board to ensure he was notified. “He is upset — he’s upset at the result but he’s very upset about the lack of notice. This shouldn’t happen.” Upenieks also took issue with the fact that Yatim is referred to as “the victim” throughout the decision, and not by name. In the decision to grant Forcillo full parole, the board wrote that it “is cognizant that (Forcillo’s) actions took the life of a much-loved son, brother, and member of the community. His loss continues to devastate his family.” The board said Forcillo has acknowledged the trauma he caused, and that he is considered a low risk for re-offending. “With the benefit of counselling, you now understand that your own fear, impulsivity, and stress contributed to your poor decision-making, poor problem-solving, and resulted in fatal consequences. As a result, you are now more cautious of the impact of your decisions and are better able to consider the consequences of your actions,” the board wrote. “It is the board’s opinion that you will not present an undue risk to society if released and that your release will contribute to the protection of society by facilitating your reintegration into society as a law-abiding citizen.” Forcillo will continue to be banned from contacting the Yatim family. In 2016, a jury convicted Forcillo of the attempted murder for shooting Yatim while he lay on the floor of an empty streetcar in downtown Toronto. Although Yatim was killed in the July 27, 2013 shooting, Forcillo was acquitted of the more serious charge of second-degree murder. The unusual verdict stemmed from a finding that Forcillo had fired two distinct volleys of shots at Yatim less than a minute after the officer arrived at the scene — a burst of three shots followed 5.5 seconds later by another six shots. Forcillo fired the first three shots at Yatim as the teen held a small knife, fatally wounding him and shattering his spine. This round of shots, on which the second-degree murder charge was based, was found to be a justified use of force. Forcillo then fired six more times while Yatim lay partially paralyzed but still alive on the streetcar floor. Yatim picked up the knife but his body never lifted off the floor. He did not pose an imminent threat and no efforts were made to communicate with him, the trial judge found in his reasons for sentencing. “The shooting of Mr. Yatim was unnecessary and unreasonable and excessive from the outset of the second volley,” he said. An inquest into Yatim’s death was announced last year but has not yet been scheduled. Forcillo began serving his six-year sentence in November 2017 after he was arrested for violating the conditions of his bail pending appeal. Forcillo later pleaded guilty to perjury for lying in a court affidavit, resulting in another six months being added to his sentence. Like almost all offenders serving sentences of more than two years, Forcillo became eligible for full parole after serving one-third of his six-year and six month sentence. He became eligible for day parole six months prior to that. July 27, 2013: Const. James Forcillo shoots 18-year-old Sammy Yatim eight times as the teen stood on an empty Dundas streetcar holding a small knife.

In North York, a 26-year-old woman was struck and killed by the driver of a tractor trailer in a hit-and-run just after 7 a.m. at the intersection of Alness Street and Supertest Road, near Dufferin Street and Steeles Avenue West, police said. The 52-year-old driver of the white, 2000 Freightliner commercial tractor — pulling a blue-coloured trailer — was making a right turn off Supertest, to the southbound lanes of Alness, when the woman was struck and killed. The intersection has a traffic light with signals for pedestrians. The driver of the truck failed to remain at the scene but was later located by traffic services investigators and is cooperating, police said. Det. Brett Moore, of the traffic services division, said it was still “pretty dark” outside at the time the woman was hit. The body of the victim, covered by an orange tarp, was in the marked cross path used by pedestrians to cross from the east side of Alness to the west. A dark-coloured knapsack was on the ground near the victim. Investigators were canvassing for video footage and witnesses, and asking anybody who has information to contact police. Alessio Cerasuolo was shocked when he dropped his wife off at work at a business about 20 metres west of the scene. His wife has been working in the area for more than 20 years for a company that makes office chairs. He said that the block is frequented by drivers of heavy trucks which bring goods back and forth to warehouses and manufacturing companies. Tractor trailers were seen making U-turns on Alness as drivers attempted to find alternative routes around the closed intersection, which was cordoned off with police tape until just before noon for the investigation. This is the second pedestrian killed on Toronto streets since the start of the year. A 65-year-old man died Jan. 4 after being struck by the driver of a vehicle near Jarvis Street and Gerrard Street East. That was also a hit-and-run. Nicole Sutherland, who was on her way to work at a high-end furniture business at the southwest corner of the intersection, was shaken when she heard the news. She has to take the bus to work. Her employer notified her of the situation, but Sutherland said she had no information where the woman worked. “There is a fair number of trucks that come into the area,” she said. “It’s more of an industrial area. There’s also a lot of bakeries.” She said the area has a patchwork of sidewalks which isn’t great for pedestrian safety, especially after a major snowfall. “There’s absolutely no sidewalks in some areas,” she said. “It’s terrible.” In a statement, Mayor John Tory said he was “committed to redesigning our roads to make them safer for pedestrians.” Tory also said he would be “consulting with Toronto Police, Transportation staff, and road safety advocates in the coming days about the need to increase penalties for drivers using our roads recklessly and with utter disregard for the lives of others.” Get more of what matters in your inboxStart your morning with everything you need to know, and nothing you don't.

Very important differences, different duties. I encourage people who are interested to look into it further or ask.

On Twitter, Farrah Khan, a member of the commission’s community advisory group, said she was “very concerned by the choice of Premier Doug Ford to bypass the OHRC application process to self-appoint two people.” Khan, manager of Ryerson University’s Consent Comes First office of sexual violence support and education, said appointments should be based on merit to “ensure independence of the commission.” NDP MPP Peter Tabuns noted the appointments of Arsenault and Violetta Igneski, a McMaster University associate professor in philosophy with Conservative links, come in the wake of the June cronyism scandal that resulted in Ford parting ways with his chief of staff, Dean French. French resigned after it emerged his family and friends received plum jobs, including a pair of six-figure foreign postings. Ford revoked those and five other people stepped down after the controversy. Igneski is related to Jasmine Igneski, who served in senior roles in the governments of Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper and Progressive Conservative premier Mike Harris. She has not responded to inquiries from the Star.

It wasn’t like Safiullah, a shy and hardworking 15-year-old, who usually came straight home from Woburn Collegiate Institute. Hamed took off looking for him. The intersection at Ellesmere and Markham roads was blocked off with police tape — probably a car accident he thought. At the nearby mosque someone told him there had been a shooting at the school and students were in lockdown. “I assumed the best and I thought he was in there taking shelter,” Hamed remembers. By 6 p.m., he got a call from his panicked mother. Come home quick, she said. He could tell from her voice something was very wrong. He ran home “and that’s where I saw three cops with my parents.” Safiullah was walking among a crowd of pedestrians when, just after 3:10 p.m., gunfire rang out multiple times. Terrified students scrambled. Safi, as he was known, was rushed to hospital where he died of his injuries. Friends, family, teachers and members of the community gathered at Masjid Al Jannah Wednesday, a mosque teps from where Safiullah was shot, to remember the kind and quiet boy who lay inside in a simple wooden coffin covered with a green and gold cloth, a single red rose placed on top. They’re left looking for answers to why the Grade 10 student was killed. Police have not said whether he was targeted or whether this was a case of mistaken identity, though Det.-Sgt. Andy Singh said the latter was “unlikely” because the shooting happened in broad daylight. Another 15-year-old student at the school was arrested minutes after the shooting. The student, who cannot be identified under the provisions of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, is charged with second-degree murder. Singh said the accused shooter had gang affiliations but it was too early to tell if it was a factor. Singh said he didn’t believe the accused and the victim were friends, and added there was nothing in Safiullah’s past that suggested he’d be in such a situation. Friends, family and police all say Safiullah had no gang ties. “He was an innocent young boy caught in the crossfire,” said Imam Hamza Wardak in his remarks following funeral prayers at the packed mosque Wednesday. Wardak taught Safiullah in an after school program for years and remembered him winning best behaviour awards. “You’d probably think that this would be the last kid who would end up losing his life like this,” he told the crowd after hundreds bowed their heads in prayer. “When everyone started running, this boy started running as well,” he told the Star before the prayers. “And then suddenly he just collapsed.” Hamed just wants to know why this happened to his brother, the youngest of four boys. “This needs to be done. A 15-year-old kid in broad daylight gets shot, it’s just nonsense, something’s wrong there,” he said. Sujanth Raveenthiran was among the crowd of students and pedestrians in the area when he heard gunshots ring out. He saw a figure laying on the ground, but only later did he realize it was his classmate. “He has a smile worth a million dollars,” Raveenthiran said, adding residents in the area are “very concerned” about gun violence. He said he’d personally like to see more police presence. Fourteen-year-old Zaid Yaqobi called Safi one of the best friends he ever had. “He was one of the few kids that were ever nice to me,” he said. “This is the kid I used to play Dragon Ball with.” Apostolos Kokkolis, 15, grew up with Safi and described him as “a good kid” who won class awards and always got good grades. “He didn’t deserve to die,” Kokkolis said. “I actually want to see this community do better ...

Grief counsellors were made available to both staff and students. “I taught Safiullah in two classes. Wonderful young man. Always happy,” wrote one of Khosrawi’s teachers on a Go Fund Me online fundraiser, which had collected more that $12,000 to support the grieving family in less than 24 hours. Arthur Matheson, who taught Safi in civics and English, was among those at the mosque for visitation before the prayers. “He was just a nice, young man. I am deeply hurt by his passing,” he said. “I never heard anybody say a mean word to him, I never heard him say a mean word.” One of the questions Toronto police are investigating is where the alleged shooter got the gun — and whether it was brought to school. They’re urging anyone with information about the shooting, including drivers and pedestrians with video footage, to contact police. Ryan Bird, spokesperson for the Toronto District School Board, said in an email Wednesday that “we have no indication that a weapon was present in the school prior to Monday’s shooting that occurred off school property and after school hours. “As with any similar case, we’re supporting Toronto Police in every way we can,” he said. Khosrawi is Toronto’s fourth homicide in 2020. Of the four people killed, three were shot and were 25 or younger. His death is a continuation of rising gun violence in the city, a pattern that last year contributed to a record-level number of people killed or injured by bullets: 292, the highest in at least 15 years. Speaking to reporters after Wednesday’s Toronto police board meeting, Mayor John Tory acknowledged that both victims and alleged perpetrators of gun violence are getting “younger and younger.” That troubling pattern will be discussed at a meeting of GTA mayors and police chiefs next week, convened specifically to address rising gun violence across the region. Tory said he hoped the meeting would prompt “significant” financial support from the other two levels of government to invest in social programming to address the root causes of crime. Although he acknowledged the federal government has provided some support and action — including a move to ban some firearms — Tory said he is “disappointed” in how much money they have provided the city. “I had been led to believe by very senior people in the government that we had such a need, that was easily understood, and that we would get the support we needed,” Tory said, noting the city has received about one-sixth of what it requested from the federal government. Amid rising violence in 2018, Toronto city council approved an anti-gun violence plan totalling more than $50 million. To date, much of that plan remains unfunded, including about $25 million in community-based initiatives designed by city staff to intervene with youth involved in conflict and prevent violence from happening in the first place. But the federal government has since rejected most of the city’s requests for money for those programs, and council has not found new funding to implement the plan. At the mosque, after packed prayers with more than 1,500 in attendance, mourners carried Khosrawi’s coffin down the stairs, on their way to a nearby cemetery. Community member Zakia Alam, speaking after the prayers, said she’d come to pay her respects. She said the shooting had shaken her sense of safety. Originally from Bangladesh, she knows what it’s like to leave your country looking for a brighter future for your children; Khosrawi’s father came from Afghanistan, a relative told the Star. Alam said it is especially heartbreaking to see tragedy happen here. “They came here for a better life, she said. “Now their son is gone.” May Warren is a breaking news reporter based in Toronto.

A lot of people feel that many police officers have literally “gotten away with murder.” Officers who kill someone are rarely charged with any criminal offence. Of the officers charged, only a small percentage are found guilty. Moreover, in the few cases where they are convicted of anything, it is almost always of an offence much less serious than murder and the sentence imposed is lenient. Of course, there are some situations in which officers are justified in killing someone to prevent serious injury to the officer or to some other person. Reasonable people can disagree about some particular cases. Sometimes there are disputes about the facts and other officers protect their colleagues by giving false versions of what happened. In the case of James Forcillo, there was indisputable video evidence. The videos show beyond any doubt that he shot Yatim while Yatim was alone on a streetcar and Forcillo was standing outside. Yatim had a knife in his hand; Forcillo pointed his gun at Yatim. After Yatim failed to respond to repeated orders by Forcillo and other officers to “drop the knife,” Forcillo fired three shots, all of which hit Yatim. Yatim fell to the floor of the streetcar. About five seconds later, Forcillo fired six more shots, five of which hit Yatim. The medical evidence established that one of the first three shots was the fatal one. There was no justification for Forcillo to fire his pistol at all; it is unbelievable that he fired six more shots as Yatim lay dying from the first three. At Forcillo’s trial, the jury was instructed that they could find him guilty of any of murder, manslaughter or attempted murder. Forcillo was acquitted of murder and convicted of attempted murder. This outcome seems strange; how could he not be guilty of murder when shots from his gun killed Yatim? We do not know how the jury came to its verdict. (In Canadian law, it is a criminal offence for a juror to disclose any information about what transpired during the jury’s deliberations.) It is reasonable to conjecture that there was much negotiating among the jurors. They might have concluded that there was reasonable doubt about whether the first three shots were justified but that the next volley of six shots was clearly unlawful. Some jurors may have felt Forcillo was guilty of murder but agreed to a compromise to avoid the mistrial that would have followed if the jury had been unable to arrive at a verdict. The maximum penalty for attempting murder is life imprisonment. The judge sentenced Forcillo to six years in jail. That is a lenient sentence for someone who acted as shown in the videos. While Forcillo was out on bail awaiting the appeal of his conviction, he broke his bail conditions and also committed perjury by lying in a sworn affidavit that his lawyers submitted to the Court of Appeal. He pled guilty to perjury; two other charges (of breach of his bail conditions and of obstruction of justice) were dismissed as part of the agreed resolution. He was sentenced to six months imprisonment for perjury, to be served concurrently with his sentence for attempted murder.

The parole board should have been skeptical of everything the perjurer communicated to them. In the circumstances, it was outrageous to grant such early parole. It sends a message to police officers that even if videotapes prove they fired numerous shots into a person lying defenceless on the ground they will be treated leniently.

An emailed statement on Tuesday from Tom Spence of the Pride communications team did not provide a reason for Olivia Nuamah’s departure. But a source close to Pride said the board of directors has decided to take the organization in a different direction that is closer to the community and less about politics. Nuamah said she enjoyed her time at Pride, but it was the right time to leave. “I’ve steered them through a difficult time, got them out of debt, tried to create stability, feel that I was able to achieve all of those things,” she said. Hired by Pride Toronto in 2017, Nuamah held the job during a controversial period in the organization and the LGBTQ community, which was shaken by the murder of eight men with ties to Toronto’s gay village amid criticism of police handling of the disappearances and killings. She was criticized by some members of the community for suggesting that uniformed police be allowed to participate again in the annual Pride parade after they were excluded following a 2016 protest of police participation by Black Lives Matter. But in a narrow vote in early 2019, the Pride membership decided that police would not be welcome at the parade for at least two years. An auditor’s report in the summer of 2018 found Pride was $700,000 in debt and suggested that it needed new sources of revenue. Nuamah said that government grants, lower spending and sponsorships from the biggest parade “in a number of years,” helped put Pride on a more balanced financial footing. “What I hope I was able to do was at least position Pride Toronto as an organization that truly represents some of the more vulnerable voices inside the LGBTQ community,” she said. Nuamah, 47, was raised in Toronto’s Moss Park neighbourhood and has an undergraduate degree in international development and social anthropology at the University of Toronto. She also has a PhD in computer science that she earned after leaving the job of executive director and secretary to the board of the Atkinson Charitable Foundation between 2010 and 2012. The foundation was founded by Star publisher Joseph Atkinson in 1942. The 39-year-old Pride parade attracts about 1.7 million people to the downtown each June, according to the Pride website.

Police found the woman dead inside the house on Atlas Avenue near St. Clair Avenue West after being called for a wellness check on Monday. A coroner later attended the scene and deemed her death to be suspicious, police said in a Thursday news release identifying the woman as Giulia Matthews, 54, who neighbours said lived at the two-storey red brick house. Her death is Toronto’s fifth homicide of 2020, police said, announcing they had made an arrest in the case. Thursday afternoon, a forensics van could be seen parked nearby as workers in hazmat suits and blue face masks carried out paper bags from the home, still blocked off with police tape. Shocked neighbours were left wondering what had happened inside. “I am so sorry,” said neighbour Carmen Sillato, who has lived on the quiet residential street for 23 years. “They are very nice people, I am so moved.” Sillato said she saw police tape around the house on Monday, but had just heard about the murder on the news. There had never been any trouble there, she said. “I always stopped and talked to the lady,” she said, calling the family who lived at the home, “such good neighbours.” Anthony Westenberg, who lives across the street, called them a “wonderful” and “quiet but friendly” family, who sat out on their porch all summer. “The whole street is left in sadness,” he said. Dannis Koromilas, another neighbour, said police had canvassed people nearby, including him, Monday evening. The house had been very quiet since late last year, he said. “I weep for her mother, you’re not supposed to bury your children.” On Thursday, Toronto police said a boy has been arrested in the case and charged with second-degree murder.

As reported in the Star Tuesday, the government quietly appointed an active Toronto police officer and a McMaster University professor with Progressive Conservative ties as commissioners, despite neither being among more than 300 applicants submitted for vetting by the rights watchdog. The news drew immediate criticism for not following an agreed-to process for filling vacant commissioner positions, nine of which were allowed to lapse after the election of Ford, leaving only Chief Commissioner Renu Mandhane in place. Her five-year term expires in the fall. Randall Arsenault, a 19-year veteran constable with the Toronto police service who has a large social media following and is an Aboriginal liaison officer, and Violetta Igneski, an associate professor in philosophy who has written on human rights, were both appointed Jan. 9 to two-year terms. Commissioners work an average of a couple of days a month, cost $10,000 each a year, and weigh in on the direction of the commission, approve litigation and inquiries, and vet reports before release to the public. The chief commissioner is a full-time position. Mandhane, and BLAC in its open letter, expressed concern that the appointment of a Toronto police officer comes as the commission is in the midst of an inquiry into allegations of racial profiling and racial discrimination by the Toronto police service. Igneski is related to Jasmine Igneski, who served as a policy adviser to prime minister Stephen Harper. She was also a senior policy adviser to Mike Harris’s Progressive Conservative government. “This attrition of commissioners, (Ford’s) apparent failure to appoint any that actually applied … and then to appoint only a supporter, and an active duty police service constable, appears to be an attempt to undermine the OHRC’s credibility,” reads the legal clinic’s open letter. The Black legal clinic is funded by the province and headed up by Ruth Goba, a former interim chief commissioner with the OHRC. Attorney General Doug Downey’s office said in a statement this week that Arsenault and Igneski were named “to support and advance the commission’s mandate to provide leadership for the promotion, protection and advancement of human rights, and builds partnerships across the human rights system.” The statement said commissioners need to “have knowledge, experience or training with respect to human rights law and issues,” and the pair were appointed “in accordance with the Ontario Human Rights Code.” The office gave no explanation why an agreed-to selection process with the commission was not followed. Igneski has not responded to requests from the Star to speak about the appointment. Arsenault acknowledged receiving the Star’s request by email but has not responded to a request to speak further. The police service said Arsenault’s “experience as a community-builder, youth mentor and Aboriginal liaison officer in his division will make him a valuable asset to the OHRC and his experiences with the commission can only translate positively” for the service.

Superior Court Justice Michael Dambrot said the jury selection process will proceed with the use of peremptory challenges, in keeping with Thursday’s bombshell Court of Appeal ruling. The challenges allow both Crown and defence lawyers to reject a specific number of potential jurors without having to give a reason. The decision found changes by the federal government to the jury selection process that end the use of peremptory challenges should not have applied to cases where an accused chose to be tried by a jury before the law came into effect last fall. However, in Ontario some judges ruled the new jury selection process should be used — which means several cases, including those involving murder and sexual assault convictions, may now be retried. A jury is expected to be selected in the Schlatter case by early next week, with the trial starting Thursday, Dambrot told the potential jurors. The trial is expected to last four to six weeks.

The premier later hailed the appointment to the human rights watchdog of Const. Randall Arsenault, who has publicly praised Ford to his large following on social media. That move came as the commission is conducting an inquiry into allegations of racial profiling and discrimination against the Toronto Police Service. “The police officer that’s serving (is) top notch. You can’t ask for a better police officer that what the attorney general appointed,” said Ford in his first public comments since the Star revealed the appointment on Tuesday. “I support our police and I support the appointment that the attorney general made.

The decision comes one year after a scandal engulfed the union, under the leadership of the former president-elect Ram Ganesh, amid allegations of improper spending in excess of $270,000. “The university has lost confidence in the RSU’s ability to represent students with good governance and to supply the services that students pay for,” reads a statement by vice-provost Jen McMillen, published on the university’s website. “It really is a decision where we believe that the university ran out of options and we would like the students to have their voice. It’s time for the students to decide what’s next,” she said in an interview with The Toronto Star. But McMillen said that the university is committed to a new student government and will be releasing details about how that will come about. “A strong student government is an important partner to any university administration and we believe in that. We also believe that we have a very engaged and committed student body, who have also expressed frustration about the way their representation has gone in recent months,” she said. “We want students to be involved in what some of those things look like, so we couldn’t have that all ready to go today, but we will be communicating that in very short order,” said McMillen. After the university learned of the alleged misuse of funds, it withheld fees the student union collects until the RSU produced a forensic audit of its finances, shared the results with the university and negotiated a new operating agreement. “Despite the university’s best efforts to be an accommodating and collaborative partner, the RSU has failed to meet the conditions set out in January 2019,” said the statement. The union posted on Facebook stating that it did arrange an audit. In a memo dated Jan. 21, 2020, the RSU said PricewaterhouseCoopers conducted an audit of the credit card usage to review the expenses under Ganesh, former vice-president of operations Savreen Gosal and financial controller Vijayatharshini Jayachandran between May 2018 and Feb. 2019. The memo further states the student union filed a report with Toronto police and said students will be able to view the report on Feb. 3. Toronto Police Service confirmed that a report was made regarding allegations from 2018, and said its investigator “has yet to speak to witnesses, therefore, it would not be in the best interest of the investigation to comment further.” Reached at the RSU office mid-afternoon Friday, union president, Vanessa Henry, said there was a lot of “misinformation” about. She said she would be interviewed by the Star after she spoke to a lawyer. Late Friday, Henry released a statement addressed to Ryerson students saying that the RSU “does not accept this termination as valid under the agreement.” “The RSU will continue to operate and support students,” the statement says. “We look forward to addressing students at our Semi-Annual General Meeting on February 3rd.” Get more of what matters in your inboxStart your morning with everything you need to know, and nothing you don't.

It operates various programs and services on campus, such as free legal aid, tax clinics, student groups and equity service centres for marginalized communities. McMillen said the university is committed to ensuring that those programs and services remain available. But she could not speak to whether there might be interruptions in some of those services. “Our goal will be to ensure that things that students rely on and ways in which students are supported, (that) those needs are met and will continue to be met through this period of transition,” she said. The student union is funded through mandatory student fees; an undergraduate student pays about $130 towards the union. The RSU has an operating budget of $2.7 million. In January 2019, documents obtained by the Eyeopener, a student newspaper, independent of Ryerson, disclosed expenditures of the RSU’s credit card that showed what appeared to be questionable charges. Among the charges was $2,280.89 for the Toronto nightclub EFS, $2,507.18 for a Cineplex Rec Room in Toronto, $696.90 for Airbnb, and $1,375.21 at Nick’s Sport Shop.

It loses the services that have been put in place and … (the discovery of) what works and what doesn’t work. It puts those services in limbo that students rely on every day,” she said. Meantime, there’s a gap in student representation, said Weiler. When there is no student union to represent them, students’ rights are in jeopardy, not just within the university, but also in their representation to governments, she said. The CSF offers its members, including the RSU, education on good governance and financial practices. It also provides support if a member university asks. Weiler said Ryerson didn’t request assistance dealing with its relationship with the university or the allegations of financial mismanagement. Ryerson Student Union was to hold elections Feb. 12-14.

Mundane though it may seem, the force’s new shift schedule experiment aims to make a big impact on everything from traffic enforcement to community policing to the overall visibility of officers. Simply put, Toronto police are making time for it. “We’ve never built that into the staffing model,” Acting Supt. Greg Watts said of proactive policing, which until now has been done when there was time but had not been given dedicated place in an officer’s day. Starting Monday, officers in the majority of the city’s divisions will spend 70 per cent of their shift responding to calls for service and the remainder doing preventative work, said Watts, who is overseeing the one-year pilot project. For decades the bureaucratic, thorny issue of when officers work has caused tension between the Toronto Police Association and the Toronto police board, the two parties to the shift schedule. Before this week’s changes, most police officers across the city were on what’s known as the “compressed work week,” made up of three overlapping shifts. Among the central criticisms of the schedule is that it’s highly inefficient, staffing 28 hours for each 24-hour day. It also sends approximately the same number of front-line officers out all times, regardless of the demand for service. The one-year pilot, which impacts the majority of the city’s front-line officers, has been dubbed the first major change in officer deployment in 35 years. In a statement Monday, both police association president Mike McCormack and Toronto police chief Mark Saunders attributed the change to collaboration between the board, the union and the police service that McCormack called “unprecedented.” “The stars have finally aligned,” said Watts. Past efforts to alter the schedule have put the board and the union at loggerheads. In a 2016 interview, McCormack said the compressed schedule was “pretty well bullet proof,” though he entertained the possibility of making changes in the name of officer wellness. Watts said gains have been made more recently through consultation with officers as well as through a U.K.-based law enforcement schedule consulting firm, paid for by the police union. Using data, including the periods of high demand in each division, a series of possible shift changes were drafted, all more efficient and better for officers’ health than the compressed work week, he said. Each of Toronto’s 17 divisions voted on which schedule they wanted to test, many choosing one that sees officers working longer shifts fewer days in a row. That schedule was tested at a Scarborough police division last year to rave reviews, Watts said.

Doctoral candidate Noah Schwartz argues the program is flawed and will not achieve its goals, while Public Safety Minister Bill Blair insists there is no place for such weapons in Canada and the buyback is part of a greater public safety campaign. The Trudeau government has promised a ban and buyback of what the Minister of Public Safety calls “military-style assault weapons.” On its face, this sounds like something that progressives should get behind. The buyback, however, won’t achieve its stated goal of reducing gun violence. It may also harm national unity and pay dividends for the Conservatives in the next election. Buying back 250,000 firearms from licensed gun owners, at a cost of $400-$600 million, will not make us safer. Canada already has strong gun control laws in place and gun owners must meet strict requirements in order to purchase a firearm, including continuous background checks. Crime in Canada is largely committed by unlicensed individuals buying illegal American handguns on the black market. For example, 75 per cent of all crime guns successfully traced by the Toronto police came from the United States. For handguns, the firearms that are most often used to commit murders in Canada, 84 per cent came from south of the border. We cannot avoid the fact that we share the largest undefended border in the world with the country that has the largest civilian stock of firearms. These types of buybacks usually don’t work as they face issues of low compliance and funnel guns onto the black market. To make matters worse, the guns this buyback is targeting (assault-weapons) don’t technically exist here. While guns like the AR-15 in Canada look like their counterparts south of the border, they are missing a key part; magazine capacity. When the United States banned assault weapons in the 1990s, they defined them as semi-automatic weapons “with a large magazine of ammunition.” In Canada, rifle magazines are limited by law to five rounds. Given that rate of fire is what makes assault weapons more dangerous, this difference is a big deal. So what’s the harm in the ban? Fewer guns can’t be a bad thing, right? But we need to consider whether this policy is worth the political and financial costs. The recent election demonstrated there is a sharp political divide between east and west in this country. The current fissure is climate change: how can we fight it while also preserving western jobs? But this flashpoint is a symptom of a deeper division that this ban will worsen. Attachment to firearm ownership in the Western provinces is much stronger than it is in central Canada. Abandoning the proposed ban could be a way for the government to show that it is sensitive to Western concerns and make it easier to negotiate on tougher issues. If the proposed ban goes ahead, the government will be spending at least $400-600 million to buy back rifles that will likely never be used to commit a crime. Recall that Canada’s last major gun control project — the long-gun registry — was projected to cost only $2 million and ended up costing over $2 billion. Gun control is expensive, and resources should be allocated where they can do the most good. This money could be better spent fighting the deeper social roots of crime by tackling the systemic issues facing disenfranchised young people in places like Toronto, who see gangs as their only viable pathway to prosperity in a Canada that has turned its back on them. Targeted intervention programs in at-risk communities, like Operation Ceasefire in Boston, have shown a lot of promise. To its credit, the government has increased funding to the provinces and territories to help tackle gang crime. But these commitments will be dwarfed by the cost of the ban. Finally, the Liberals are gambling that young people care about gun control, which they do. But gun owners facing the confiscation of their personal property care a lot more. Conservative Party strategists could hardly ask for a better fundraising tool. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is struggling. The Conservatives won the popular vote in the last election and a new leader is sure to energize them for the next. This ban will no doubt motivate hundreds of thousands of gun owners to join the party, volunteer their time and help fill the Conservative’s coffers. It might just be enough of a wave to ride them back into government. Noah Schwartz is a doctoral candidate in political science at Carleton University. His research focuses on understanding the gun culture in North America. Prior to my current role as the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, I served for a decade as the chief of the Toronto Police. I’ve spent my life trying to keep people safe, and I have seen first-hand the devastating impact gun violence can have on families and communities. Most firearms owners are conscientious and law-abiding, and they have my utmost respect, but when their guns get into the hands of someone with violent criminal intent, tragedy results. This isn’t limited to urban centres, either — rural gun violence is a problem as well. And so we must take decisive action to strengthen gun control. Criminals obtain guns three ways: they are smuggled, stolen, or diverted. We will act decisively to cut off this supply. In addition, we will end the proliferation of military-style assault rifles in Canada.

École Polytechnique, Sainte-Foy, and Moncton — these guns have been used in Canada to kill women, religious minorities, innocent civilians, and police officers. They have been used all over the world to commit horrendous atrocities — look no further than Sandy Hook Elementary School and Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue. Chiefs of police have been calling for a ban on military-style assault rifles for decades. We intend to ban these guns and offer a buyback option to Canadians who currently own them. A buyback program would allow us to safely dispose of these weapons, ensure fair compensation for owners, and ensure that these powerful guns are removed from our communities and rendered inoperable. It is money well spent to protect the public. We know that the large majority of firearms owners are responsible in how they acquire, store, and dispose of their weapons. They have our full support, and we will work with our partners to develop a buyback program that works for everyone. But that’s not all we’ve promised Canadians. In the last election, we vowed to make our communities safer, and that requires more than just banning military-style assault rifles. We also said we were committed to giving cities the ability to ban or restrict handguns, and increasing our government’s already historic investments to fight gang-related violence. THE BIG DEBATE: For more opposing view columns from Toronto Star contributors, click here. But let me be equally clear about what we will not do: We will not bring back the long gun registry, and we will not target guns designed for hunting. Hunters, farmers, law-abiding recreational gun owners — these people deserve our respect, and we will ensure that they are treated fairly. Our government’s commitment to safer streets is not new. In the last four years, we’ve already taken important action to address gun violence. We invested $327 million to give police and prosecutors new resources and tools to fight gang-related violence and address gun smuggling. We also brought in legislation that ensures stronger background checks. But we have even more important work ahead of us. Banning military-style assault rifles, giving cities the ability to ban or restrict handguns, and doing even more to tackle gang violence are just pieces of our larger, holistic plan to make our streets safer. We intend to make unprecedented investments in kids and communities, because we know that improving social conditions goes a long way in reducing crime and violence. We will empower police to take preventative steps to keep a dangerous situation from becoming deadly. We’ll strengthen our border, tackle the criminal diversion of handguns, and see stricter storage laws act as a deterrent to theft. And through it all, we will work closely with provinces, territories, and municipalities, empowering them to take actions necessary and appropriate to their circumstances. Strengthening gun control demands thoughtfulness and careful consideration. But we cannot be afraid of change. Canadians are asking for real leadership to address gun violence, and real leadership is exactly what we will deliver.

Mayor John Tory initiated Tuesday’s meeting at city hall — which included mayors from Brampton, Mississauga, Pickering and Markham, regional chairs from Peel, Durham and York — to discuss solutions to combat the “unacceptable” level of shootings across the GTA. The closed-door gathering saw sobering new statistics about those victimized and allegedly causing the rising violence: across the region, perpetrators and victims have been getting younger and younger. “It doesn’t really matter what the age is — if these things are happening, by definition, that’s bad,” Tory said. “But it’s…even more disconcerting and more challenging for us to deal with a group of people principally who are much younger.” Toronto has recently seen record-level violence, with 292 people killed or injured in a total of 492 shootings in 2019, the highest number in at least 15 years. According to the most recent Toronto police statistics, there have been 23 shootings so far this year, four of them fatal. Of the four people killed, all were in their 20s or younger, including Safiullah Khosrawi, 15, who was shot dead after leaving Scarborough’s Woburn Collegiate Institute last week, allegedly by another 15-year-old. Tory said Tuesday’s meeting is the beginning of a concerted approach among municipal, provincial and federal governments to reduce the violence spiking across the GTA — a problem growing, the mayors and chiefs say, in part thanks to gun smuggling over the U.S. border. “There’s a real job to do at the border,” Tory said. According to Toronto police statistics, 82 per cent of the handguns they seized in 2019 and traced originated in the U.S., with the remainder coming from Canada. However, of the 453 handguns Toronto police seized, nearly a quarter — 107 — were not traced, according to the data. Solicitor General Sylvia Jones said Ontario Provincial Police figures put the number of traceable illegal guns slightly higher, at 84 per cent coming from the U.S. Next steps include a meeting between local police services and the Canadian Border Services Agency. Joel Lightbound, the parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, said the federal government is “listening,” and admitted there should be improved intelligence sharing between the border agency and local police to allow them to “collaborate more efficiently.” Lightbound also referenced the forthcoming $250 million federal dollars earmarked for crime prevention strategies, promised by the Liberals during last year’s election. He said that money is specifically intended for crime prevention. Tory said the GTA mayors agree that further and more co-ordinated investments are needed in programming for at-risk youth, families, communities, and stressed that federal funds are needed “now.” “We can’t do this alone,” he said. “Property taxes were never meant to fund what amounts to social programs, and this is very much a shared responsibility.” Tory has repeatedly called for greater federal funding for youth programs while facing criticism about city money handed to police to combat violence. Last year, municipal, provincial and federal governments each gave $1.5 million to Toronto police to beef up the service’s guns and gangs task force, an initiative that police say led to meaningful gains but did not result in a reduction of shootings. According to the city budget presented earlier this month, there are few youth violence prevention initiatives set to receive new city funding, though nearly $1 million will be spent on four new, dedicated youth spaces this year. The city wants the federal government to fund another $1.5 million for youth violence prevention and intervention but has promised to backstop those programs with reserve funds this year if those investments don’t come. The GTA mayors are also calling for “substantially tougher” bail laws, a frequent suggestion made by Tory and Saunders in recent months that has drawn significant pushback from lawyers and other justice experts.

Of those 97, 17 were charged with a new firearm offence; four of those 17 were released again on bail, and one of whom was later charged for a third time for a firearm offence. “It deflates the police officers and community representatives, to have to look people in the eye and say after all the work is done, all the money that’s expended on bringing these people to justice, that then people see them and police officers see them in the community hours later,” Tory said. “It’s a system that is not working,” he said.

Meanwhile, there is a dearth of provincial data: Ontario’s Ministry of the Attorney General does not track the number of people who are granted bail for firearm offences and go on to be charged with a new offence, whether its another firearm offence or otherwise. Irvin Waller, a University of Ottawa criminology professor, told the Star late last year that more data could help the debate between police and defence lawyers regarding bail. Regardless, he said, while there may be cases of a person living a gang lifestyle reoffending while on bail, “this does not account for the level of homicides that we’re seeing in Toronto for the last three or four years, and for the shootings that are continuing.” In general, Crown attorneys must seek detention at a bail hearing for anyone charged with a firearm offence unless there are exceptional circumstances. The mayors are also calling for greater use of electronic monitoring bracelets to help people out on bail stay on track. But the system is not functional in part because the bracelets must be paid for by the accused, something those gathering Tuesday said should change, Tory said.

Police said the man was crossing Dundas Street West near Scarlett Road around 8:30 p.m. when he was hit by a 42-year-old man driving east on Dundas towards the intersection. The pedestrian was taken to hospital with life-threatening injuries. He was later pronounced dead in hospital. The 76-year-old man had not been crossing at a crosswalk or controlled intersection when he was hit, police said. The driver remained at the scene, police said. In a separate incident in Scarborough, also Monday evening, police said a 38-year-old woman was crossing Morningside Avenue at the eastbound off-ramp of Highway 401 around 6:15 p.m. when she was hit by a 54-year-old man driving south on Morningside. She was taken to the hospital with life-threatening injuries, police said. The intersection at Dundas West and Scarlet Road is a complicated one for pedestrians. There are traffic lights, but zebra crossings are painted only on the eastside of Dundas for pedestrians walking north or south on Scarlet. A westbound TTC bus stop is located on an island in the middle of Dundas westbound lanes and the right-turn lane. While there are crossing marks, pedestrians trying to cross Scarlet on the north side of Dundas have to watch for car drivers turning left toward Scarlet, or those turning west into Dundas. Visibility can be impeded as those drivers turning right into Dundas West are coming from underneath the bridge holding the train tracks. The nearest intersection with crossing signs on both sides is at Humberhill Avenue, approximately 200 metres away. It’s believed the driver hit the pedestrian somewhere between these two intersections. A woman who works at a dry cleaning facility across from where the accident took place said she wasn’t there when it happened but spoke to police Tuesday morning as they canvassed for security video evidence. She said it’s common to see people jaywalking instead of crossing at both nearby intersections. There’s a Toronto Community Housing building next to the Dundas-Scarlet intersection on the southern side of Dundas, where most pedestrian traffic in the area originates. Victoria Etudaiye was clutching two shopping bags as she followed the crossing signs and waited for her traffic signals before heading home Tuesday morning. She hadn’t heard about the 76-year-old pedestrian death nearby, but it didn’t surprise her. “It can definitely feel dangerous around this intersection,” she said. “This is a very busy area and there are so many cars and not enough space on the sidewalks.” Etudiaye has lived in the building for the last four years. She said the narrow space on the sidewalks can seem even narrower during the winter months when snow piles up and is not cleared out quickly. “You just try to be vigilant all the time, and follow the traffic signs. It’s very important,” she said. Willina Mishka, who works as a nanny in the area and is usually pushing strollers through the neighbourhood, said she was not aware of the Monday incident but added near-misses are very common. Last fall she was nearly knocked over by a distracted driver, while she attempted to cross an intersection on Jane Street. “There was a crossing guard with me waving a sign. I literally did everything right but still it didn’t matter,” she said, noting it’s not nearly enough for pedestrians to be obeying the rules if drivers don’t pay attention. “Everybody drives too fast and makes it scary,” she said. The 76-year-old victim is the third pedestrian killed on Toronto streets this year. Get more of what matters in your inboxStart your morning with everything you need to know, and nothing you don't.

The NDP is calling on federal privacy commissioner Daniel Therrien to launch a probe into how the RCMP and other Canadian law enforcement agencies use the controversial tool, which can allow police to quickly check citizens’ faces against databases of mug shots or social media profiles. “The power of this technology to radically alter the basic notions of privacy is evident … The potential for abuse is enormous,” NDP ethics critic Charlie Angus wrote in a letter to Therrien that was obtained by the Star. “Any use of such technology must be carried out under clear judicial oversight. However, this technology is being tested and implemented in a legislative and judicial background.” Numerous police agencies, including the Toronto Police Service, have facial recognition programs already up and running, but there’s been little public debate about acceptable uses for the powerful technology. In a report last year, Toronto police Chief Mark Saunders said his force only uses facial recognition technology in criminal investigations, and sharply limits the number of officers with access to the database. Only lawfully obtained mug shots are included in the database, Saunders said. However, police forces in other jurisdictions are less restrictive in their use of the technology. The New York Times recently reported on a U.S. company called Clearview AI, which offers facial recognition databases to law enforcement agencies, the contents of which have been scraped from social media profiles and websites. According to the Times, Clearview has a database of more than three billion images scraped from websites including Facebook and YouTube. Police agencies — or anyone else Clearview sells its services to — simply upload a photo of their target to find a match. According to the company, more than 600 law enforcement agencies have started using it in the past year. It’s not clear if any Canadian agency has purchased Clearview AI’s services, but Angus said it’s “imperative” Canadians understand more about how this type of technology can be used. “At this time, the RCMP has refused to state whether or not they are using this technology. If they are, it could represent a real risk to Canadians’ privacy,” Angus wrote to Therrien. It’s not hard to understand the appeal such technology has for law enforcement — the ability to quickly identify victims or perpetrators of a crime, to track down publicly available but difficult to find information online, or even to identify individuals from images taken of large crowds. But for all the technology’s potential, studies have also raised questions about its accuracy. Internet freedom advocacy group OpenMedia noted that some facial recognition software has a higher error rate when attempting to identify people of colour and women. There’s also little clarity about which police forces use facial recognition, how they use it, and which Canadian laws and regulations apply to the use of such tools.

The company was using mall directories to capture the age and gender of shoppers, as well as “monitoring traffic” through its properties.

The community is not entitled to a particular verdict.” Making repeated mention of the high-profile and divisive nature of the trial, lawyers for Const. Michael Theriault and Christian Theriault urged Di Luca, hearing the judge-alone trial, to acquit the brothers of the aggravated assault and obstruction of justice charges they face stemming from a violent December 2016 clash that left Miller, then 19, seriously injured. Accusing Miller of lying on the stand — “I’m not going to soften my words because we have a courtroom of people,” Lacy said — the defence lawyers said Miller’s inconsistent and “false” testimony claiming he was attacked by a pipe-wielding Michael Theriault can’t be believed. A finding of guilt would “vindicate” lying on the stand “and that’s a miscarriage of justice,” Lacy said, adding Crown lawyers had “no business” asking Di Luca to convict on any of the charges based on the evidence. Acknowledging some credibility issues in their case — including competing accounts among Miller’s associates about what prompted the alleged assault — Crown prosecutors Linda Shin and Peter Scrutton nonetheless say that when all the trial evidence is considered, “there can be no doubt that Michael Theriault wielded the pipe — not Dafonte Miller.” “We are asking you to accept that a retreating Dafonte Miller was the victim of a vicious, two-on-one assault perpetrated by Michael and Christian Theriault that left him with life-altering injuries,” Shin said in court Wednesday. To render his decision, Di Luca will have to cut through the competing narratives to determine who was wielding the long, metal pipe found by Durham Region police officers summoned to Erickson Drive, the residential Whitby street where the Theriault family lives and the alleged assault took place. At trial, no one could account for where it came from. According to Miller, Michael Theriault struck him with it moments after the brothers approached him and his friends while they were walking down the street. He alleges he was kicked and punched by both brothers and hit in the head with the pipe by Michael Theriault, causing his severe eye injury. Michael and Christian Theriault say they heard Miller and another man breaking into their parents’ truck, and after giving chase, Miller armed himself with a pipe. Michael Theriault said he then began punching Miller as hard as he could, inadvertently causing the eye injury. Court heard from a forensic pathologist that the most likely cause of the injury to Miller’s eye was at least one punch, though he said it was possible it was caused by the pipe. The metre-long pipe was found spattered with only Miller’s blood. According to Lacy and Christian Theriault’s lawyer Alan Gold, Miller had a motive to arm himself with the pipe after he was “caught in the act of committing the indictable offence” — stealing from the Theriault family truck. With Miller wielding the pipe, the use of force used by Michael Theriault is therefore “completely reasonable and proportionate” because he was defending himself against someone armed with a deadly weapon. Lacy said if Di Luca accepts this version of events, “then the defendants necessarily need to be acquitted.” Crown lawyers stress that independent evidence points to Michael Theriault wielding the pipe. No independent witness saw Miller touch the pipe, and in addition to his eye injury, Miller “suffered a fractured wrist that was consistent with a defensive injury from blunt trauma, like being hit with the pipe,” they state in written submissions. Michael Theriault, meanwhile, suffered no injuries and Christian Theriault had a small scratch on his hand.

Scrutton told Di Luca that if he finds that Miller did not attack the Theriault brothers with the pipe, he must also conclude that the brothers lied to police, and therefore convict them on the attempt to obstruct justice charge. In written filings, the Crown lawyers say the brothers’ misleading and false evidence was in an effort to “evade liability” — and it was initially successful.

The Theriault case has attracted significant attention in part because of the racial dynamic of a white police officer and his brother beating a young Black man. At the outset of the trial, Kingsley Gilliam, with the Black Action Defence Committee, said he and other group members would attend the case to “send a message to the Durham police, the Toronto police, the police everywhere.” “We will never accept this kind of conduct from them in a free and democratic society,” he told the Star last year. Miller’s personal lawyer Julian Falconer, who is not part of the criminal case, has also alleged there was a police coverup: the alleged assault did not come to light until months after the fact, when Falconer brought the case to Ontario’s police watchdog, the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which ultimately charged the brothers. Neither Toronto police nor Durham Region police contacted the SIU, despite Miller suffering serious injuries. In written filings, the brothers’ lawyers say the “narratives” pushed by Miller at trial, as well as in the media and on social media “bear no resemblance to what actually happened.” “This case is not about race,” the defence lawyers write. “It is not about excessive use of force by an off-duty police officer or a civilian.” Di Luca is expected to return his decision April 9.

The proposed changes, which are not final, are found in what the government calls a “consultation paper,” shared this month with legal groups to begin a discussion on how Ontario can “fix its outdated and slow judicial and justices of the peace appointments process,” said Jenessa Crognali, spokesperson for Attorney General Doug Downey. “The paper was a useful starting point for meaningful dialogue, but it should in no way be mistaken as a conclusion or result of this critical discussion,” she said. “So far, the attorney general has received thoughtful feedback from justice partners, and this practical input will form the foundation of solutions that may be formally proposed to fix the process for appointing judges and justices of the peace.” The province’s biggest legal organizations told the Star that there have been no complaints about the appointments process or calls to fix it. They argue the process has produced a diverse and merit-based group of judges appointed by governments of all political stripes, including the current government. “This all looks like patronage and an attempt by the attorney general to get appointments that he wants,” said William Trudell, chair of the Canadian Council of Criminal Defence Lawyers and a former member of the judicial appointments committee. Currently, the independent judicial appointments advisory committee — made up of judges, lawyers and members of the public — screens applicants and provides the attorney general with a ranked shortlist of at least two candidates for each judicial vacancy. The attorney general is required to pick from that shortlist, though he is entitled to send the list back and ask for a new one. In a statement to the Star, the Ontario Court of Justice said the process is recognized internationally and is the “gold standard” for the appointment of independent and qualified judges. Downey is suggesting possible changes to the legislation that would include requiring the committee to provide him with the full list of all applicants for a vacancy, classified as “qualified” and “not qualified.” According to the consultation paper, the attorney general would only be permitted to select a candidate from the “qualified” list. But he would also be entitled to require the committee to re-assess someone who was on the “not qualified” list, so long as they meet the minimum requirements to be a judge, meaning they’ve been a lawyer for at least 10 years. Downey is also proposing that the committee be required to turn over information to him about applicants, including those deemed not qualified. The consultation paper offers the first detailed view of what the government has in mind regarding changes to the judicial appointment process, an idea Downey initially floated late last year and for which he received major pushback from legal organizations. “They are not going to appoint people who disagree with their politics, which has nothing to do with being a good judge or not,” said John Struthers, president of the Criminal Lawyers’ Association. Struthers highlighted in a letter to Downey that recent appointments by the government to other bodies give him cause for concern, including appointing an active-duty Toronto police officer to the Ontario Human Rights Commission while it investigates allegations of racial profiling by Toronto police. The process proposed by Downey would resemble some elements of the federal judicial appointments process, in which the federal justice minister sees all applicants classified as “highly recommended,” “recommended” and “unable to recommend” — but critics have argued Ontario’s process is more robust. “The federal appointment process should be moving in the direction of our province’s (appointments committee) — not the other way around,” Struthers wrote in his letter to Downey. Legal groups agree with some of the minor changes proposed by the government, such as allowing lawyers to apply electronically for a judicial position. The Ontario Bar Association, which said it is against the idea of re-assessing “not qualified” candidates, emphasized its support for the proposal that there should be regular public reporting by the committee of diversity statistics related to applicants. A similar committee also screens applications for justices of the peace, who preside over bail hearings, sign off on search warrants and hear non-criminal cases known as provincial offences. That committee currently classifies candidates as “not qualified,” “qualified” and “highly qualified” and the attorney general can only select from the “qualified” or “highly qualified” lists. Downey is proposing to do away with the “highly qualified” category, and that he be able to require the committee to re-assess a candidate deemed “not qualified” and to receive information about applicants.

For four days, Tess Richey’s family desperately searched for her. It was Richey’s mother, not the police, who found her youngest daughter’s body in a stairwell in Toronto’s Gay Village on Nov. 29, 2017, one day before the aspiring flight attendant who dreamed of seeing the world would have turned 23. Richey had been “sexually assaulted and brutally strangled to death by a man whom she’d just met,” Crown prosecutor Beverley Richards told a jury Thursday, giving an overview into the evidence the jury is expected to hear over the next four to six weeks. A combination of security video, DNA evidence, witness testimony and a jailhouse conversation with undercover officers will show that man was Kalen Schlatter, she said. Schlatter, 23, has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder. Richards said Schlatter, then 21, followed Richey and her friend out of a popular bar in the Gay Village, and surveillance video shows him eventually leading her into a stairwell where he attempted to have sex with her. “Schlatter was upset because Tess Richey told him no,” Richards said. Surveillance video shows Schlatter walking away from the stairwell alone 45 minutes later, she said. Richey was never seen alive again, Richards said. Her family began looking for her later that day, after there was no response to her sister Rachel’s messages. The Toronto police were sharply criticized for failing to properly investigate Richey’s disappearance, amid concerns that missing-persons cases linked to the Gay Village were not being taken seriously. Her case was among those which prompted the police board to commission a sweeping review of how Toronto police handles missing-persons investigations. On Thursday, at the start of Schlatter’s trial for first-degree murder, Richards gave a detailed account of what the Crown expects the evidence will show happened in Richey’s last hours alive on Nov. 24 and 25, 2017. Richey, the youngest of five sisters, had spent the day with her sister Rachel after an emotional break up with her boyfriend the day before, Richards said. That night Richey and her high school friend Ryley Simard went to the Crews and Tangos bar on Church Street so that Richey could dance and drink away the pain of the breakup, Richards said. She texted Rachel around midnight when she got to the bar, Richards said. This was the last time Rachel heard from her sister. Schlatter was at the bar too, according to security video, though he never interacted with Richey or Simard, other than a brief exchange with Simard outside the bar at around 2:15 a.m., Richards said. Security cameras show Schlatter followed the two women when they left the bar and walked north up Church Street at around 2:20 a.m., Richards said. A hot dog stand vendor on Church St. is expected to testify the three got hot dogs — Schlatter paid — and they continued to walk north on Church. Around 3 a.m., they turned onto Dundonald Street and walked by Michelle Teape, who was having a cigarette on the front steps of her home, Richards said. Teape will testify that Richey apologized for being too loud and then introduced herself, Simard and Schlatter, Richards said. Richey quickly confided in Teape about her break-up and heartbreak, Richards said. Richey was intoxicated but was not slurring her words or stumbling, she said.

Teape went back into her home, and video surveillance shows that Simard left Richey with Schlatter around 4 a.m., Richards said. Richey walked towards Church Street with Schlatter trailed “well behind her,” she said. Extensive video surveillance the jury will see from that night shows no signs of affection or physical contact between Richey and Schlatter, Richards said. At 4:02 a.m., Richey ordered an Uber to pick her up near the corner of Dundonald and Church — near the stairwell where her body was found. It was set to arrive at about 4:14 a.m but, the driver is expected to testify, Richey wasn’t there, Richards said. He will testify he messaged her twice before cancelling the trip, Richards said. At 4:14 a.m., she said, security video from a nearby construction site will show that Schlatter led Richey up a gravel driveway toward the stairwell of a Church Street building under renovation; 45 minutes later, Schlatter leaves alone and walks north on Church.

Schlatter was arrested at his home and charged with Richey’s murder on Feb. 4, 2018. While at Toronto police’s 13 Division, two undercover officers were put in the same cells. For about three hours, Schlatter bragged about his sexual conquests and his ability to pick up women, which he often did at gay bars including the Crews and Tangos bar, Richards said. Schlatter told the officers he likes a challenge and that sometimes you have to push the boundaries with women to see where it goes, Richards said. Schlatter said he’d gone to the Crews and Tangos bar on the night of Nov. 24, 2017, and that is where he met Richey. He was walking with Richey and her friend, who left on a streetcar, leaving him and Richey alone. He said he wanted privacy with Richey so they could have sex and he saw and he saw an alleyway near a house under renovation, Richards said. As they were making out and grinding in the alley, he ejaculated in his pants, Richards said he told the officers.

Here’s some background on the case. Richey, 22, was reported missing to police on Nov. 25, 2017. She was out with a friend in Toronto’s Gay Village and had spent the night prior to her disappearance at Crews and Tangos, a popular drag bar and neighbourhood fixture. Richey’s mother, Christine Hermeston, travelled to Toronto from North Bay to help look for her. Four days after she was reported missing to Toronto police, Richey’s body was found by her mother in a stairwell, mere steps from where she was last seen. Const. Michael Jones and Const. Alan McCullough were charged under the Police Services Act with not performing a duty and not carrying out an order in Richey’s disappearance. Their hearing has been put off until Schlatter’s criminal trial is over. Richey’s disappearance was one of many connected to the Gay Village, sparking public outrage and backlash against police, with many in the LGBTQ community claiming that officers weren’t protecting them. For years, men with a connection to the village had disappeared. Missing person posters were a common fixture in the downtown neighbourhood in November 2017. Police would eventually arrest Bruce McArthur, who pleaded guilty to killing eight men. One day after Richey’s body was found, Toronto police identified the body of a transgender woman found in the Rosedale ravine in August 2017. Alloura Wells was last seen in July, and her family had reported her missing in November the same year. The family was allegedly told that her disappearance was not a high priority as Wells had been homeless for some time.

Tory’s announcement, made at a North York community centre on Monday amid ongoing criticism over the lack of city spending on community-based programs, represents a significant shift in how the city plans to spend its own money to solve the problem of rising gun violence — although even more funding is needed, those involved say. Half the money will be spent on 14 additional youth hubs this year, Tory said. That and funds already in the 2020 budget would see 20 new spaces within existing libraries and community centres funded this year — doubling the number of safe, dedicated, city-run sites where young people can get homework help, a snack, mentorship or just hang out. Another $2.1 million will go to grants of up to $200,000 per year for three years for 10 to 15 community organizations already working to prevent youth violence. The new money will help “stop gun violence in these neighbourhoods and help young people to get involved in ... results-driven projects that we know are already making a difference,” Tory told reporters at Falstaff Community Centre, near Jane Street and Highway 401. “If you can get one young person in here whose life you turn around and keep them away from gangs, violence and drugs, then that is a victory for us.” Tory said he expects criticism from “the worst of the armchair commentators” who “rant and rave” about social spending, but said he has no doubt the money will make Toronto safer. He also stressed he is pushing for investments in police, and for the federal government to make it harder for people accused of gun crimes to get bail. The mayor said he’ll continue to make those points during a trip to Ottawa this week. The city’s existing youth hubs have proven to be wildly popular with youth. As part of their 2020 budget submissions, the Toronto Public Library reported that library program attendance had increased 32.6 per cent in the past decade, largely due to the new hubs. The first word out of Bill Sinclair’s mouth when he heard Tory’s announcement was: “Wow.” Sinclair, who runs St. Stephen’s Community House, said stable grant money can be the difference between hiring staff part-time or full-time, or between a program being seasonal or year-round. “It might actually encourage talented youth leaders to devote some time to this kind of work,” he said. “Three years funding is very important so that people who have knowledge and skill and caring in the community can commit to work on this issue for three years and build those trusting relationships that are essential.” After Coun. Josh Matlow proposed a plan to double the number of city-run youth hubs — which are modelled on St. Stephen’s successful after-school programs — during the 2018 election, city staff drew up a plan of how that could be possible. The plan was presented to council during the 2019 budget process but Tory rejected the idea, calling it a “tough budget year,” and it failed to find funding without his support. Falstaff Community Centre, where Tory made his announcement Monday, was one proposed location for a new youth hub. That community centre is near where 16-year-old Hanad Abdullahi was gunned down last summer. “This was not the first shooting that happened at Falstaff, and this probably won’t be the last,” a family friend told the Star at the time. On Monday, Matlow called Tory’s pledge a “significant investment” in the lives of Toronto children. “Youth spaces are proven to provide opportunities to our most vulnerable youth. They can make communities safer and they change lives,” he said. “There is no better way to decrease youth violence than providing options for our youth.” If approved by council, the funds would more than double the new spending already proposed for youth violence prevention in the 2020 budget, according to numbers city staff provided in a budget briefing note to council members. Tory’s announcement followed the shooting deaths of three young men in the downtown Fort York neighbourhood over the weekend. All of them were aged 21 and under. Two other men were injured. In a statement Saturday, Tory called the incident “completely unacceptable” and promised action this week. The shooting was just the latest in the escalating number of injuries and deaths that has taken a major toll on the city’s youth. During a violent summer in 2018, council approved a more than $50-million plan to tackle gun violence. But the city has so far failed to fund most of the community-based initiatives, a gap of $26.2 million. The entire plan relied on funding from the provincial and federal governments, requests which were largely rejected. Although Tory says he has continued to keep up the pressure on those governments, the money has not materialized and council has not covered the gap. Since the anti-gun violence plan was approved but not properly funded, 53 people aged 13 to 29 — the target of the city’s programs to address violence — have been killed in Toronto, not including homicides believed to be domestic. On average, that’s about one death every 11 days. Last year saw more people killed or injured by shootings than any other year in police data dating back 15 years, including the so-called “Year of the Gun” in 2005.

The police budget has ballooned over $1 billion with nearly $8.5 million for new officers in the 2020 budget. City staff and others have been trying to get council and other levels of government to fund proven community-based solutions that researchers and community workers say are the best hope of tackling the city’s gun violence problem in the long-term, calling increased enforcement a “Band-Aid” solution. Studies of the roots of youth violence, notably collected and analyzed in a 2008 report to the Ontario government, have highlighted the need to address systemic problems of racism, poverty and other issues that have led to a dearth of equitable opportunities for young people in some parts of the city — a lack of education, recreational options, safe spaces and job opportunities. Irvin Waller, the author of “Science and Secrets of Ending Violent Crime”  and a professor emeritus at the University of Ottawa, said that Monday’s announcement is “long overdue” good news. But, he said, it is a “very small step in the right direction,” particularly compared to money spent reacting to violence, particularly on policing. Two of the announced initiatives may lead to short-term reductions in violence, Waller said, pointing to a Sunnybrook Hospital pilot called Breaking the Cycle of Violence with Empathy. “We know that intervening at critical moments in these high-violence, young men’s lives can make a turn-around,” Waller said. He also highlighted the money for community grants, saying that if the money is going to agencies where street workers are able to do outreach to “high-risk” individuals, “then it will be good news.” “I just wish that it was much bigger amounts of money,” he said. Longer-term, Waller said, Toronto needs a “more serious” strategic plan that has a stated vision for crime reduction, such as a 50 per cent reduction in gun-related homicides.

Tory’s office said the mayor’s budget chief Coun. Gary Crawford will propose using money from the overachieving municipal land transfer tax to fund the new investments while still putting additional funds from those tax revenues into a rainy day reserve fund, as per council policy. That motion will be made Tuesday at budget committee. Council will approve a final budget on Feb. 19. With the mayor championing it, the proposal is likely to pass easily at council. $2.1 million for community youth violence prevention grants, up to $200,000 per year, per established organization for three years. The funding would be spread across 10 to 15 organizations serving young people aged 10-29. $1.8 million for eight new youth hubs located in Toronto Public Library branches providing safe, dedicated spaces for youth people to get homework help, have a snack, participate in programs and hang out. $1.2 million for six new youth hubs in community centres, which operate in a similar way. $635,000 to fund the Regent Park social development plan proposed by city staff but not yet included in the 2020 budget. The plan developed with the community is focused on increasing safety and spurring economic and other opportunities. $100,000 for a Sunnybrook Hospital pilot called Breaking the Cycle of Violence with Empathy, which is meant to connect patients involved in community violence with interventions and other support services. $100,000 to expand the city’s crisis response grants to help communities rebuild after violence.

On Jan. 18, police were observing a 37-year-old man who was a person of interest in an investigation, the Special Investigations Unit said in a statement released Monday. Around noon, officers confronted the man on McCowan Road, south of Town Centre Court. After what the SIU called an “interaction,” several officers fired shots and the man was struck multiple times. The man was rushed to hospital for treatment and pronounced dead Monday. SIU spokesperson Monica Hudon said the watchdog would not be releasing the man’s identity “at this time . . . in accordance with the SIU’s name release policy,” which requires next of kin consent to release names. A source with knowledge of the investigation confirmed to the Star that the dead man is Ricardo Miraballes, who was charged with first-degree murder in the Jan. 13 death of Maryna Kudzianiuk. Kudzianiuk’s body was found after a fire at an 18th-floor apartment unit at 25 Bay Mills Blvd., near Sheppard Avenue East and Warden Avenue. The SIU said its investigation is continuing. The SIU is an arm’s-length agency that investigates reports involving police where there has been a death, serious injury or allegations of sexual assault.

Kalen Schlatter, 23, is facing a charge of first-degree murder in the case. He has pleaded not guilty. The 22-year-old aspiring flight attendant was found dead in a stairwell near where she was last seen alive on Church St. on Nov. 25, 2017. The jury is expected to hear evidence from the people who last saw Richey alive and undercover officers who spoke to Schlatter after his arrest while posing as his cellmates. The Crown alleges Schlatter told the officers he was upset because Richey refused to have sex with him. The Toronto police were sharply criticized for failing to investigate Richey’s disappearance properly. This took place amid concerns that missing-persons cases linked to the Gay Village were not being taken seriously. Her case was among those which prompted the police board to commission a sweeping review of how Toronto police handle missing-persons investigations. The Star will update this story as the trial progresses. It is set to last six to eight weeks. Jan 30: The trial began with the Crown’s opening address to the jury. Prosecutor Beverley Richards gave a detailed account of the evidence the jury is expected to hear, which includes surveillance video the Crown said will show Schlatter and Richey walking towards the stairwell where her body was found, and Schlatter walking away alone 45 minutes later. Richey’s body was found four days later. The Crown said Schlatter’s semen was found on the outside of Richey’s pants. The trial also heard from police witnesses who took the jury through photos of the various locations around Church Street, including the stairwell. Jan 31: Rachel Richey, Tess Richey’s older sister, gave emotional testimony about the last time she saw her sister alive — Nov. 24, 2017 — and the frantic search that began the next day. Their mother, Christine Hermeston, drove down from North Bay to help in the search. Four days later, Hermeston and her friend were searching the area around Church Street where Richey was last seen alive. Hermeston’s friend Ann Brazeau testified, through tears: “I just saw her lying there and I went into complete shock. Horror. Disbelief. I couldn’t process or make sense of what I was seeing …. I was terrified.” The trial also heard from Kabous Abadi, a hot dog vendor who said two women and a man came by his stand on Church Street in the early hours of Nov. 25, 2017. The man paid. He recognized the women when police came by with photos. Feb 3: Uber driver Marlon Allamby testified that he responded to a request for an UberPool from Tess Richey’s account at 4:02 a.m. on Nov. 25, 2017, on Church Street. She never showed up. The jury also heard more testimony about the discovery of Tess Richey’s body in the external stairwell of a house under renovation at 582 Church St. around 3 p.m. on Nov. 28, 2017. Const. Robert Chevalier, a neighbourhood police officer based in the Church-Wellesley neighbourhood, said he joined the investigation after seeing a flyer about Richey at the 519 Community Centre that morning. He said missing people in the area were a concern, and noted that at the time serial killer Bruce McArthur had not yet been caught. Chevalier said he met Richey’s mother and friend in the afternoon. They asked him to check out the address of a nearby house. Shortly after he got there, he heard a scream. He went into the alleyway and saw the stairwell, obscured from the main street by a gravel pile. He saw a dead body in the stairwell, with a pink handbag next to her. Court ended at around 2:30 p.m. because a juror injured herself in a fall over the lunch break. The rest of Chevalier’s testimony was postponed to the next day. Feb 4: In one of the most difficult moments of the trial so far, the jury was shown photographs of Richey’s body as it was found at the bottom of a stairwell leading down to the basement door of a house under renovation on Church Street. Richey’s family left the courtroom while the photographs were shown in court. The trial also heard from Ryley Simard who had gone out drinking and dancing with Richey at the Crews and Tangos bar on Church Street the night she was killed. Simard, who was one of the last people to see her friend alive, testified that she and Richey were asked to leave the bar at around 2 a.m., both very drunk. They walked along Church Street, stopped at a hot dog stand, and then stopped outside at a house on Dundonald Street where Richey had a conversation with a woman. While the hot dog vendor testified Schlatter was with the two women at the hot dog stand, Simard did not mention it in her testimony. She did testify that she kissed Schlatter goodbye on the lips before she went home around 4 a.m., leaving Richey and Schlatter in the Church Street area. Feb. 5: On the night Kalen Schlatter was arrested, Feb. 4, 2018, he was put in the police station holding cells with two undercover officers posing as two men arrested for possessing stolen property. One of the undercover officers began his testimony Wednesday from behind a screen meant to conceal his identity from the public. He is known as Undercover Officer 1. Schlatter told the officers he’d been arrested for Richey’s murder and claimed they’d met at the Crews and Tangos bar where they kissed and danced, the officer testified. He said that after her friend went home, he led Richey into the alley and then stairwell to “hook up” but was “pissed off” when she refused to have sex with him. He claimed she wanted to stay in the stairwell and he asked her if he should stay. She said no and he left her there alive, the officer said Schlatter told him. “Mr. Schlatter said he was drunk and something could have happened, but he doesn’t remember and he doesn’t think he’s capable of doing it,” the officer recalled. Court ended at 1 p.m., with the officer’s examination-in-chief set to continue the next day. Feb. 6: The testimony of the undercover officer concluded just after 11 a.m. The jury was then dismissed for the day for reasons of ensuring a fair trial “through no fault of counsel for the defence or counsel for the Crown.” Superior Court Justice Michael Dambrot apologized to the jury for the inconvenience. The cross-examination of the officer by the defence is expected to start Friday morning. Feb 7: One of Schlatter’s defence lawyers, Lydia Riva, argued the undercover officer’s memory and notes of the conversation with Schlatter in the cells was unreliable, cannot be trusted and that he omitted key context. The conversation was videotaped, but not audio-recorded. Riva suggested there were important discrepancies between the memories of the two undercover officers. The second officer has not yet testified. She also suggested that Schlatter bragged about his sexual exploits with women, because he is bisexual and was afraid of how he might be treated in jail if that were known. Feb 10: For the morning, the jury watched hours of soundless video clips of Schlatter in a small holding cell, with an undercover officer in a cell on either side. He can be seen speaking, though it is impossible to know what he is saying. The jury has heard that the police did not get a judicial authorization for an audio recording of the conversation between Schlatter and two undercover officers. But the jury has not heard why. Feb 11: One of the undercover officers’ handlers, who supervised the undercover operation, testified that there was an “officer protection kit” in the cell with the first undercover officer. The device allowed the handlers to listen to the conversation solely for officer safety, which in this case meant possible medical issues or distress, he said. He said he did not listen to the content of the conversation, only for any indication or signal of a problem from the officers. He said he did not take notes of the conversation as that would not be allowed. The jury also heard from the second undercover officer, who gave a much less detailed account of the conversation than the first. He corroborated some of the account given by the other officer but defence lawyer Lydia Riva pointed out some differences and omissions. The second officer could not recall if Schlatter said he was “pissed off” or upset that he could not have sex with Tess Richey. Riva also seized on the differences in words. The second officer said Schlatter said he was “acting” emotional when shown photos of Richey’s body by the police, while the first said he said he “pretended” to be emotional. Feb 12: The jury began viewing surveillance videos seized from the Crews and Tangos bar showing the movements of both Schlatter and Richey from the night of Nov 24, 2017. The jury also saw the security video that the Crown says shows Richey and Schlatter walking towards the stairwell where Richey’s body was later found, and Schlatter walking out alone 45 minutes later. Feb 13, 14 and 17: The trial did not sit. Feb. 17 was Family Day and court was closed. Feb 18: The jury continued watching security videos from Crews and Tangos. They watched Richey and Simard dancing under strobe lights in the crowded bar. The two women occasionally crossed paths with Schlatter, who was also at the bar, but they don’t appear to notice each other at all. Feb: 19: In the morning, the pathologist who conducted the autopsy of Richey’s body testified. Dr. Kona Williams concluded Richey had been strangled to death, possibly with a soft cloth ligature, a forearm pressed against her neck or in a chokehold. The time of Richey’s death is consistent with when she is last seen alive on the security videos with Schlatter, around 4 a.m. on Nov. 25, 2017 but Williams could not pinpoint an exact time and said it could have been later. In the afternoon, the jury resumed watching security footage. They saw Richey and Simard leave Crews and Tangos at around 2:18 a.m. and linger on the sidewalk for some minutes before they started walking north on Church St. Schlatter is also standing on the sidewalk outside the bar. Simard goes up to Schlatter and they speak briefly – the Crown has said this was Schlatter offering a light for her cigarette but Simard did not recall the interaction when she testified. Schlatter could also be seen slowly moving north on Church St., the same direction as Richey and Simard. Feb 20: The jury saw the last security footage of Richey alive. At about 4:15 a.m. on Nov. 25, 2017, Schlatter and Richey walked hand-in-hand into the alley off Church Street where her body was found days later at the bottom of a stairwell leading to the basement of a house under renovation. Schlatter leaves the alley alone about 45 minutes later. The detective who reviewed the footage from cameras all around the area, including motion-activated cameras with a view of the fence at the back of the house, said he didn’t see Richey leave or anyone else go in or out of the area for the next two hours. Feb 21: During cross-examination the defence drew the jury’s attention to another man seen in a pink hat in the videos. The defence has suggested they will argue it is possible another person was responsible for killing Richey after getting to the alley and stairwell by climbing over a fence at the back. Feb. 24: Cross-examination on the video evidence ended and the jury heard testimony from a police officer who executed a search warrant on Schlatter’s home. Photos of Schlatter’s bedroom, which showed board games and video games, were used by undercover officers to find common ground with Schlatter while they posed as recently arrested men in holding cells next to Schlatter. The jury has heard Schlatter opened up after one of the undercover officers mentioned the card game Magic: The Gathering. Feb 25: The Crown introduced several text message conversations taken from Schlatter’s phone after it was seized by police upon his arrest on Feb. 4, 2018. The messages included flirtatious and sexual conversations with women in the days and months after Richey was last seen alive. The jury has heard two undercover officers testify that Schlatter boasted extensively about his sexual exploits with women. The defence has suggested he was bragging out of fear of what would happen to him in jail if it were known he is bisexual. In one text, from 9:46 p.m. on Nov 26, 2017 — almost two days after Schlatter and Richey were captured on video walking into the alley — he told one woman: “This weekend has been the worst for me and I’ve been so stressed out.” Get more of what matters in your inboxStart your morning with everything you need to know, and nothing you don't.

Feb 27: Undercover Officer 1 was recalled and further questioned by the defence. Using the faint audio from the booking room video, the defence suggested the officer was the one who prompted conversation with Schlatter. The officer said it was Schlatter who prompted the conversation and said he could not make out what was being said between him and Schlatter in the background audio. The jury also heard evidence from a toxicologist about the amount of alcohol Tess Richey had in her system at the time of her death — at most 206 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood. A forensic biologist testified about the DNA evidence obtained from Richey’s clothes. Semen on her pants and saliva on her bra were found to match Schlatter’s DNA. Feb 28: The testimony of the forensic biologist concluded and court broke around 11 a.m. Mar. 2: The trial did not sit. Mar. 3: In testimony that at times appeared straight out of “The Wire,” a combative life-long criminal and self-professed liar who once shared a jail cell with Schlatter testified that Schlatter confessed to strangling Tess Richey with a scarf and ejaculating on her body after she refused to have sex with him. Schlatter said he was “too worked up” to stop, the jailhouse informant who can only be described as E.S., told the jury. While E.S. said he was only testifying for “the dead girl and her family” and that he was not receiving any consideration from the Crown for his own pending charges, the defence suggested he had manufactured the confession in order to help himself in the future. Mar. 4: E.S., who became increasingly hostile and insulting towards Schlatter’s defence lawyer during cross-examination, concluded his testimony. The jury then heard evidence about Schlatter’s cellphone records. Mar. 5: The jury heard from a correctional officer at the Toronto South Detention Centre, who testified about the period of time E.S. and Schlatter were in custody together. The jury also heard from Det. Ted Lioumanis, the officer-in-charge of the case. He said that on Dec. 10, 2017, the police released images of a man from an ATM security video. Kalen Schlatter called in to the police station and said he was the person in the photos. However, when at the station he did not admit to being the person in the photos. Police obtained his DNA off a water bottle Schlatter had drunk from and discarded.

Sgt. Graham Gibson who testified about how police came to arrest Schlatter. Police had been working on getting a judicial authorization to record the undercover operation in the cells, however it was not completed when Schlatter was arrested. Gibson said the decision to arrest Schlatter was a matter of public safety. “It was a stranger-on-stranger homicide,” he said. “I couldn’t guarantee eyes on him all the time.” He also said he did not want to arrest Schlatter at his home because of the potential for a volatile and dangerous situation. Schlatter was arrested on Feb. 4, 2018 after watching the Superbowl at a movie theatre with his family. The Crown closed their case at the end of Gibson’s testimony.

It’s not appropriate, it’s not safe and far too often it’s resulting in tragedies like this,” Ward 10 Coun. Joe Cressy (Spadina-Fort York) told reporters on Saturday. He made his remarks outside of a condominium building on Queens Wharf Road in the Fort York neighbourhood where gunfire erupted at about 10:30 the night before. A social gathering was underway at the time in a 32nd-floor unit that was being rented via Airbnb. Three men — all age 21 or under — died. Two other men were injured, one of whom is in serious condition in hospital, while the other was treated on scene and is cooperating with investigators. Police said they are no longer looking for a suspect. They have confirmed that the shooter(s) died in the shooting. Alex Li, a media relations officer with Toronto police said the victims have been identified as Jalen Colley, 21, of Brampton, Joshua Gibson-Skier, 20, of Brampton and Tyronne Noseworthy, 19, of Toronto. Li said police recovered two firearms from the scene and that the shooting took place in the unit and the hallways adjacent to it. Cressy called on short-term rental operators, such as Airbnb,  to delist “multiple listings and ghost hotels ... delist all these properties today.” In an email to residents Friday afternoon, the building’s management said they will ban short-term rentals. In a later email, management notified residents that a new security company, Cavalier Security, has been hired for the building. They did not clarify why a new company had been hired. In the notice, the property manager of 85 Queens Wharf said the board and management had discussed the issue of short-term rentals many times, “and unfortunately, we have many (owners) that are in favour of short-term rentals as well as many against.” However, it said in light of the incident and violence in the city “we will be drafting and sending out a new rule” to limit renting any unit for less than three months. Condo owner Shane Rivers said it’s not the first time there has been a shooting in a short-term vacation rental in the building. Enough’s enough, he said. “We can’t keep letting this happen. What are we going to do? Wait until a resident gets shot?” he said. Rivers said he bought his condo three years ago, and had no idea there were so many Airbnb rentals in the building at the time. As he was speaking to a reporter, a man dragging a suitcase walked by. Asked if he was renting an Airbnb unit in the building, the man said yes: “I’m supposed to say my cousin lives here.” He said he had been given instructions on what to say if anyone questioned him. Rivers said he attended a recent condo board meeting where there was some discussion on banning short-term rentals but it didn’t go very far. He said he was told 75 per cent of condo owners would need to vote in favour of such a ban. But there was some doubt expressed as to whether that could happen since so many owners rent their units out through agencies such as Airbnb. As well, only a fraction of owners attend condo board meetings, he said. “We are not getting international tourists. These are kids coming in to party,” said Carly Zedic, who often stays in the building with her boyfriend who owns a unit. The city has been trying to rein in short-term rentals since it passed regulations two years ago that were supposed to take effect in June 2018. Short-term landlords, including one whose legal fees were paid by Airbnb, appealed the regulations at the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal. That appeal was rejected by the tribunal in November, paving way for the city to proceed with the new rules, which would limit short-term rentals to a landlord or tenant’s primary residence. However, a group of landlords announced in December they planned to ask a divisional court for leave to appeal the rules. Spadina-Fort York MP Adam Vaughan had harsh words for Airbnb, charging that the organization is placing lives at risk. “Airbnb is deliberately making these neighbourhoods dangerous and I think Airbnb has a lot to be held to account for,” he said.

And you have to step over them to get to your doorway. It is one thing for a man my size to walk through that, but when it’s your daughter or your kid trying to get home, it's not a safe situation,” Vaughan continued. Friday’s incident follows another shooting in a Toronto Airbnb in August, when a man suffered life-threatening injuries after he was shot at an Airbnb listed in the Bridle Path. Police said there were 20 to 30 people in the Airbnb at the time of the shooting. Just before the new year, Airbnb announced a ban on house parties that extended to Canada and around the world. In response to Friday’s shooting, Airbnb sent a statement Saturday saying it was investigating the incident. “We are deeply saddened by the tragedy that occurred in Toronto last night and our thoughts are with all who have been impacted ... We have zero tolerance for this type of behaviour, and we ban both party houses and unauthorized parties on our platform.” RELATED STORIESGTAAirbnb’s ban on party houses extends to CanadaNov. 04, 2019GTAWhat Toronto’s new Airbnb rules mean for party rentalsNov. 19, 2019GTAMan seriously injured after shooting at Bridle Path Airbnb rentalAug. 04, 2019 Airbnb has banned the booking guest and said that no previous safety incidents had been reported at the listing, wrote spokesperson Lindsey Scully in an email. “Airbnb formally bans all ‘open invite’ parties as well as any large events in condo or apartment buildings,” Scully wrote. Home-sharing watchdog Fairbnb said Toronto’s Airbnb market has become crowded with “ghost hotels,” homes taken out of the long-term rental market by absentee hosts to be used as tourist rentals, noting the highest density was in Toronto’s waterfront community. “There’s no more time for half-measures,” said Fairbnb spokesperson Thorben Wieditz. “Airbnb can show it takes the lives of guests and neighbours seriously by following Toronto’s regulations, delisting “ghost hotels,” and ending its support for hosts’ appeals.” In a statement, Mayor John Tory said the shooting was “unacceptable,” adding the city’s community crisis response team has been mobilized to support the neighbourhood. “Early next week, I will be outlining additional proposed investments in neighbourhoods to help young people and directly address the root causes (of) violence.” Correction — Feb. 3, 2020: This article has been edited to remove an incorrect reference to the ages of the men killed in the shooting.

The fugitive, 32-year-old Adan Perez Huerta, was arrested in Toronto and returned to Arizona, where he was booked into a jail Thursday. An arrest warrant was issued for Huerta after he pleaded guilty to negligent homicide but didn’t appear for his sentencing in 2003. The case stemmed from the 2002 death of a 19-year-old woman who was his passenger in a vehicle driven by Huerta. She was fatally injured when the vehicle struck an electrical box and caught fire in a Phoenix suburb. Huerta, who also was seriously injured in the early morning wreck, had a blood-alcohol level of 0.16, the Chandler Police Department said in a statement. That’s twice Arizona’s legal limit of 0.08. A Chandler detective last spring began searching for Huerta by checking social media posts of his relatives and associates, and those eventually led to posts by Huerta himself, said Sgt. Jason McClimans, a department spokesman. McClimans said the detective was able to determine Huerta was in Toronto, leading to his arrest by Toronto police. U.S. marshals took Huerta into custody, and he was extradited to the United States. “Social media always leaves a digital footprint,“ McClimans told The Associated Press in an email. Chandler police believe Huerta lived in Canada for at least a year, and he apparently was using his real name before being arrested, McClimans said. Jennifer Liewer, spokeswoman for the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office, said Huerta for now is only charged in the homicide case. Additional charges may be filed after a prosecutor reviews the file, she said. Huerta’s defence attorney, Paul Ramos, said Saturday he could not comment.

The shooting in August sparked criticism towards Airbnb’s rental policies from tenants’ groups, who argued that Airbnb’s accountability and rating system is not well-equipped to deter these dangers. In November, a 19-year-old Humber College student sued Airbnb after he was shot while attending a large party at a house rented through the online platform. In the lawsuit, Sean McCann, the plaintiff, alleged that Airbnb should have known that rental properties like the one in Etobicoke, where the shooting occurred, were commonly used for parties and attracted violence.

Tess Richey’s mother found her daughter’s body four days after she vanished in November 2017, Rachel Richey testified. “She was screaming and she told me that she found her and she just kept saying it,” Rachel Richey said through tears at the first-degree murder trial of Kalen Schlatter, who has pleaded not guilty. “I said ‘Is she alive?’ She said ‘No.’” It was Nov. 29, the day before Tess Richey would have turned 23 years old. Her mother, Christine Hermeston, and another sister had driven down from North Bay, Ont., several days earlier to look for her. Upon hearing from her mother, Rachel Richey tore out of her Toronto home clutching her baby, but forgot her shoes, she said. She ran back and grabbed them before getting in a cab. She arrived at a building under construction in the city’s gay village, where a police officer guarded the scene. She was directed to a waiting ambulance and found her mother inside. “I got into the ambulance with my mom and there’s not really much to say,” Rachel Richey said. “The next few minutes, I just cried a lot and hugged my mom.” The families had been scouring the area since Tess Richey vanished in the early hours of Nov. 25. The young woman had gone out with a friend after spending the day with Rachel. Rachel Richey had been comforting Tess Richey, who had recently broken up with her boyfriend. Tess Richey then left to meet up with a friend at Crews and Tangos, a bar in the gay village, Rachel Richey testified. The prosecution alleges Schlatter met Richey on Nov. 25, 2017, outside a bar in Toronto’s gay village and sexually assaulted then strangled her after she refused his advances. Rachel Richey said she last heard from her sister at 12:01 a.m. that night in a text saying she had gotten to the bar. In the prosecution’s opening address to the jury on Thursday, Bev Richards said Schlatter’s DNA was found on Richey’s pants and bra. She said surveillance video shows Schlatter leading Richey to a stairwell of a building under construction around 4:14 a.m. — around the same time she was supposed to get into an Uber. She said the video, which is expected to be presented at trial, will then show Schlatter leaving alone 45 minutes later.

City council is about to debate Toronto’s budget for 2020, and it should unanimously back the mayor in adding $6 million of new money for these programs. That would more than double the new spending set aside for preventing youth violence in the coming year. There’s no doubt it goes in the right direction at a time when the city is in the midst of a spate of shootings and deaths that are costing the lives of far too many young people and injuring many more. But let’s not get too carried away. Toronto has had a notoriously spotty record when it comes to developing programs to combat this kind of violence, and an even worse record in making sure they receive adequate and stable funding. Far too often, we’ve seen the same depressing pattern: a spate of high-profile shootings, followed by politicians scrambling to reassure the public that they’re on it. Ambitious-sounding plans are announced, only to shrivel when the spotlight turns away and the money dries up. That happened in 2014, when Toronto council approved an ambitious “youth equity strategy” — only to leave it chronically under-funded and ineffective. It happened again in 2018 when councillors approved a gun violence plan that would have cost more than $50 million. Sounded good, but it depended on funding from the federal and provincial governments and much of that never came through. The key, clearly, is in the follow-through. The city must commit to funding community-based programs for the long term, and senior governments must do their part to support it. There’s nothing really new in any of this. We’ve known for many years, at least since the landmark Roots of Youth Violence report of 2008 ordered by the McGuinty government after the so-called “summer of the gun” in Toronto, about the alienation and hopelessness that fuels gang violence and gun crime in many communities. The same report laid out a host of solutions that should have been put in place at the time. But there has never been a consistent commitment to putting such programs into effect and paying for them year after year. At least not enough of a commitment to survive the changing political climate and the whims of public opinion. Money is promised, but all too often it becomes impossible to find when the gunfire dies down and attention turns elsewhere. In that regard it’s good to see that the plan put forward on Monday by Mayor Tory would provide additional money for community-based projects over the next three years. More permanent, ongoing funding would be even better, and would provide the kind of stability that organizations working with young people say is needed to show real results. Tory’s plan would also establish new youth hubs in public libraries, add new youth spaces in community centres, and fund a social development plan in Regent Park.

Ryley Simard testified she and Tess Richey, who had recently broken up with her boyfriend, became “quite intoxicated” at a bar in the hours before Richey disappeared on Nov. 25, 2017. Outside the bar Crews and Tangos, Simard testified, is where the pair met Kalen Schlatter for the first time. “He was tall, with dark brown hair and slim, that’s it,” Simard said. She said she could not recall whether she spoke to him other than saying “Hi.” The prosecution alleges Schlatter sexually assaulted then strangled Tess Richey after she refused his advances some time after 4 a.m. that morning. Schlatter has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder. Richey’s mother and a friend of hers found the 22-year-old’s body in a stairwell four days after the young woman’s friends last heard from her on Nov. 25, 2017. Simard said Richey was upset earlier that night because staff at the bar had kicked her out and the pair were unsure what to do next. She said they walked north along Church Street before stopping at a hot dog stand. Then she remembered kissing Richey on the cheek and then kissing Schlatter on the mouth. Simard’s memory of the night was spotty due to the alcohol she drank and the cannabis she smoked, she testified. Another witness, Michelle Teape, told court last week she met Richey, Simard and Schlatter some time around 3 a.m. outside her apartment, where she was out with a friend. Teape said she heard laughter from the trio before Richey stopped to apologize for making so much noise. She struck up a quick kinship with Richey, in part due to the young woman’s sadness. “She told me she was upset because she just broke up with her boyfriend,” Teape testified. Richey became upset when Simard said she wanted to leave, Teape said. That’s when Schlatter “walked behind (Richey) and put his hands on her shoulder and he said ‘I got this,’” Teape said. Simard testified she only recalled being outside Teape’s house with Richey and “a male.” She could not say if that man was Schlatter or not.

Kalen Schlatter told two undercover officers he was “pissed off” when Tess Richey refused to have sex with him but that when he left her in a Church Street stairwell in the early hours of Nov. 25, 2017, she was alive, court heard Wednesday. “Mr. Schlatter said that when he left her, she was alive, so maybe she took her own life but he doesn’t know,” one of the Toronto police officers testified at Schlatter’s ongoing first-degree murder trial. “Mr. Schlatter said he was drunk and something could have happened but he doesn’t remember and he doesn’t think he’s capable of doing it,” the officer recalled. He testified that he and the other officer — their identities are covered by a publication ban — joined Schlatter in the holding cells of the 13 Division police station around 3 a.m. on Feb. 5, 2018, posing as two men who had been arrested. Schlatter had himself been arrested mere hours earlier, on the night of Feb. 4. Investigators knew Schlatter, then 21, enjoyed board games from a photograph of his bedroom taken during a search warrant, the officer testified, explaining how he tried to get the suspected killer to open up by mentioning he and his co-accused were going to miss an appointment to learn about the fantasy card trading game “Magic: The Gathering.” At this, the officer testified, Schlatter sat up off his bed and said he had a high ranking in the game. The conversation then turned to his sexual exploits, in which he described how he picked up women at gay bars and said, “sometimes you have to push the boundaries with women” to see where it goes. When the undercover officer asked why Schlatter had been arrested, he said he told him police were saying he’d killed Tess Richey, a 22-year-old aspiring flight attendant. Schlatter has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder in her death. The Crown is arguing he sexually assaulted and strangled Richey before leaving her body in the stairwell of a house on Church Street where it was discovered four days later by her mother and a friend. The conversation between Schlatter and the undercover officers was not recorded. The officer, who introduced himself to Schlatter as “Mike” and his co-accused as “Jesse,” testified he did a “brain dump” onto a notepad about three hours later. Only some parts of the conversation were Schlatter’s actual words, the officer said. Schlatter told the officers he met Richey at the Crews and Tangos bar in the Gay Village. He said he met her at the club and that he was “dancing with her and kissing her and grinding with her,” the undercover officer said. Schlatter said he lost her inside the bar, but saw her with a friend outside the club and they continued to flirt while they were both very drunk. He said her friend then had to go and got on a streetcar, the officer said. In its opening address, the Crown told the jury that security video from the bar shows no interaction between Schlatter and Richey that night inside or outside the club. The Crown also said there was no evidence Richey had any physical contact with Schlatter or displayed any signs of affection towards him around 4 a.m., as Richey’s friend Ryley Simard left. On Tuesday, Simard testified that she gave Schlatter a kiss before she left. The undercover officer testified that Schlatter said he saw an alleyway by a big house under renovation and took Richey in there so they could “hook up.” He said they went to the landing at the bottom of the stairwell for more privacy while they were “making out and grinding.” Schlatter explained that this made him ejaculate in his brown Eddie Bauer pants, and that the wet stain got onto her pants, the officer said, an explanation for how his DNA got on her clothing. Schlatter said he wanted to have sex with her but she said she was on her period, the officer testified. Schlatter continued that Richey would not let him finger her, and said she was “falling over drunk,” the officer said. When they stopped kissing, Schlatter said Richey told him she wanted to stay at the bottom of the stairs but he wanted to leave. He said he asked her if he should stay and she said she didn’t want him to. He then said he left, the undercover officer testified. Schlatter said he wouldn’t have taken Richey into the alley if he’d known there were cameras because he wanted privacy, the officer said. He also told the undercover officers that Richey’s mother found her at the bottom of the stairs, not the police and that the “police screwed up the search,” the officer said. Two Toronto police officers are facing professional misconduct charges for allegedly failing to properly investigate Richey’s disappearance. Their hearing has been put off until Schlatter’s criminal trial is over. Schlatter repeatedly said his lawyer had told him not to speak to anyone and that he had been silent when questioned by detectives, the undercover officer said. But he said trusted the two men whom he considered his brothers, and said they couldn’t tell anyone what he said or he’d be “screwed,” the undercover officer testified. The officer said he assured Schlatter he wouldn’t say anything. Schlatter said the detectives showed him pictures “of the dead girl and it didn’t faze him at all ... they were trying to get a reaction out of him,” the undercover officer said. Schlatter said he pretended to cry but really felt nothing at all, the officer said.

Allan Mann Jr. has been charged with abduction for allegedly kidnapping his son Jermaine in 1987, Toronto police said. He was extradited to Canada after finishing an 18-month stint in a U.S. prison for illegally obtaining government benefits while eluding authorities. “They lived, basically, a life of lies as to who they were and what they did, unbeknownst to Jermaine,” Toronto police Det. Sgt. Wayne Banks said upon Mann’s October 2018 arrest. “He was under the impression that his mother had died shortly after birth.” Mann was in court Thursday for a bail hearing, but a court official said it was postponed until Monday. Toronto police allege Mann kidnapped his son during a court-ordered visitation in 1987 before fleeing to the U.S. and obtaining fake identities for them both. Mann’s American lawyer, David Ring, said his client fled Canada with his son because he worried about the boy’s safety during a bitter custody dispute with his wife, who planned to take the child to Jamaica. U.S. authorities said Mann acquired counterfeit birth certificates for him and his son, which were later used to obtain a Social Security number. American prosecutors said Mann used the alias Hailee DeSouza to collect more than US$125,000 in housing benefits and more than US$55,000 in Medicaid assistance. He pleaded guilty last year to one count of making a false statement. U.S. marshals and Toronto police launched a new effort to find Mann in 2016 while meeting at a law enforcement conference on capturing fugitives. The marshals interviewed several of Mann’s friends and family members, including a relative who pointed authorities to Connecticut and Mann’s alleged alias. He was ultimately arrested in Vernon, Conn.

The decision effectively ended the voyeurism prosecution of the Toronto condo owner, Michael Chow. He had argued police had breached his rights by going into the apartment and seizing the camera without a warrant, even though the aggrieved guest had invited an officer in. “The police not only breached Mr. Chow’s rights by entering and searching the apartment without a warrant, but they continued to breach his rights by seizing his property and searching it,” Ontario court judge Joseph Bovard said in the decision. “Admitting evidence that was obtained in such a manner would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.” The case arose in September 2018 when Robert Wallenberg, in town for the Toronto International Film Festival, rented the downtown Airbnb apartment from Chow for 10 days. After discovering the hidden camera, Wallenberg contacted Airbnb, which advised him to go to a hotel and call police. Court records show Wallenberg let the officer, identified as Const. Lewis, into the apartment and showed him the clock-camera. On advice of a detective, Lewis seized the gadget and placed it in a property locker at the police station. Another officer later inspected the camera briefly, then applied for a warrant to search the device. After finding stored video of people engaged in various activities in the bedroom, including one man masturbating on the bed and others, including Chow, in various states of undress, police charged the owner with voyeurism. At trial, Chow argued for exclusion of the video evidence on the basis that police violated his rights with the warrantless search and seizure. Lewis testified he made no attempt to contact Chow before entering the condo. He said he believed he was justified in going in at Wallenberg’s invitation because the Airbnb guest had the key and temporary ownership of the unit. He said he seized the device on the advice of the detective to preserve potential evidence. In his analysis, Bovard said a key issue in deciding whether police had breached Chow’s charter right against unreasonable search and seizure was whether the owner had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the condo unit. Bovard concluded Chow did, given evidence that he was the sole owner of the apartment, it was filled with his possessions, and he used it himself at times. “In these circumstances, Mr. Chow had a subjective expectation of privacy in the apartment,” Bovard concluded. “Mr. Chow had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the clock-camera and in the contents of the SD memory card.” The judge also rejected prosecution arguments that by renting out his condo to Wallenberg, Chow had undermined his own privacy expectations. “Whatever rights Mr. Wallenberg had over the apartment, he could not waive Mr. Chow’s privacy rights in the apartment and its contents,” Bovard said.

An officer with 21 years on the force, Const. Mike Austin died Thursday night shortly after his shift at Toronto Police Operations Centre. Though his death is being probed by Ontario’s Office of the Chief Coroner, Toronto police Chief Mark Saunders confirmed Friday that his death is not suspicious and is being investigated as a suicide. “We are grieving the tragic loss of our friend and colleague, and we offer condolences and support to the member’s family at this time,” Saunders said on Twitter Friday. “Mike was loved by many and he will be missed,” he said. According to a source with knowledge of the death, Austin died inside the parking garage at police headquarters. The death at the College St. building — the home base of the force, housing the offices of the chief and the Toronto Police Services Board, alongside major police units including the homicide squad — cast a pall over headquarters Friday as word spread. In the early morning hours, Saunders sent an email to all Toronto Police Service members advising them of the death and urging them to talk to someone for help if they needed it. Members of the service’s Critical Incident Response Team were brought in to offer support throughout the day Friday in the auditorium at police headquarters, and Saunders’ note also included a list of mental health and wellness resources. “The loss of one member affects all of us as a police family. It is important we grieve and support each other through this tragic time,” Saunders said in the internal email. “He was a great guy; he’ll be missed,” said Toronto Police Association president Mike McCormack in an interview Friday. “It’s so sad, for him and his family.” Before working out of police headquarters, Austin walked the beat with downtown’s 51 division. In 2006, he was shot at by a man in Regent Park, an incident he recalled in harrowing detail at a trial in 2007. “You can run really fast when someone is trying to kill you,” he told the court. Condolences began pouring in online Friday as news of Austin’s death spread. “Mike worked tirelessly with no fanfare behind scenes to help save people’s lives,” wrote Toronto police Const. Scott Mills on Twitter. “It often was not easy. He was the guy to call in middle of the night to track a concerning social media post to save a life. He cared.” “I worked with (Police Constable) Mike Austin professionally back in my security days at Ryerson. He would often attend calls for us and was a great leader and mentor to many of us,” wrote Toronto police parking enforcement officer Erin Urquhart. “May he rest peacefully.” “I am heartbroken to hear of Cst. Austin’s death. My deepest condolences to the Austin family, the @TorontoPolice family and the broader policing family,” wrote Ottawa police chief Peter Sloly, a former Toronto police deputy chief. Last September, an Ottawa officer died by suicide inside police headquarters. A high ranking officer also died by suicide at Ottawa headquarters in 2014. Austin’s death comes amid growing awareness about the mental health toll of policing, following a spate of suicides in recent years. After nine active or recently retired police officers died by suicide in 2018, Ontario’s chief coroner Dr. Dirk Huyer convened an expert panel to review the circumstances of the deaths and make recommendations.

And then it spread like wildfire. “PLEASE SHARE,” the caption urged, before alleging the man groped a young woman who was sleeping while sitting next to him around 10 a.m. the same day. The post went viral, shared and reshared across Toronto on various social media platforms. After an investigation, Toronto police arrested a man Thursday and alleged that he sexually assaulted two women in January. When someone shares their sexual assault experience, it makes women feel safer to share their stories, said Farrah Khan, manager of Consent Comes First at Ryerson University. “Too often we brush off those stories or we’re told to brush off those stories, to say it wasn’t so bad, you weren’t ‘raped,’ he just groped her breast,” Khan told the Star. “Sometimes you think like, did that really happen? The most common response to sexual violence is freezing. When one woman validates and verifies that not only did this happen, but it’s a big deal, it opens up the floodgates almost to allow women to really take seriously what happened to them.” Khan said she couldn’t comment on this specific arrest but spoke broadly on how social media can influence people to come forward with their own experiences of sexual violence. “Social media has changed in some ways how we share information when things happen,” she said. Speaking out about something publicly can be empowering. “The thing that keeps sexual violence going in a lot of ways is the shame blame and fear,” Khan said. “There’s this idea that we’re asking for it — especially with young women” between the ages of 16 and 25, who face a higher rate of sexual violence than women in other age groups. Often, people experience something Khan calls “bystander apathy,” meaning they are less likely to intervene when people are present due to fear of being seen as a problem. Or people reassure themselves that the situation isn’t a big deal and they don’t need to intervene. It is common for witnesses to harmful situations to freeze up. Taking action right away is great, Khan said. “We want people to intervene, we want people to support the person who’s been harmed,” Khan said. An open conversation about sexual violence is empowering women to come forward with their own experiences. “We’re normalizing that it does happen, that we need to take action, that we have a responsibility to take action,” Khan said, urging public institutions like the TTC to say that people have the responsibility to speak up.

While questioning one of two undercover officers placed in the cells with Schlatter in the early hours of Feb. 5, 2018, defence lawyer Lydia Riva also suggested her client bragged to the officers about his sexual conquests with women because he feared how he would be treated in jail as someone who identifies as bisexual. The officer testified he had no knowledge that Schlatter self-identified as bisexual and said he was not aware of video that showed him dancing with a man at a gay bar the night of Richey’s murder. Tess Richey, a 22-year-old aspiring flight attendant, was found dead in the outside stairwell of a house on Church Street on Nov. 29, 2017. Schlatter, 23, has pleaded not guilty to her first-degree murder. The Crown is arguing Schlatter sexually assaulted Richey and strangled her after she refused to have sex with him sometime after 4 a.m. on Nov. 25, 2017. In court Friday, Riva questioned specific details of the undercover officer’s recollection of the holding-cell exchange between himself, Schlatter and the second officer. The first officer had testified that Schlatter told him “sometimes you have to push the boundaries with women” to see where it goes while describing his techniques for picking up women at gay bars. Riva said Friday her client actually said he “never pushed the boundaries” and “if she wants to sleep with you she will, pushing the boundaries will just make things worse.” The officer said that is not what Schlatter said. Riva also noted that the exchange was not recorded but asked whether any other officers were listening in. The undercover officer said there was a device that allowed his handlers to listen in and monitor the conversation for his safety, but that he didn’t know who exactly heard it and if they took notes. No reason has been given for why the conversation was not audio-recorded. The officer only took rough notes after three-and-a-half hours of conversation then made formal notes hours later, Riva noted. She questioned whether his recollection of specific words he claimed Schlatter used — such as that he said he “pretended to cry” when the police showed him photos of Richey’s body — was accurate. The undercover officer maintained the word “pretended” was accurate. Riva said there were discrepancies in what the two undercover officers recalled Schlatter saying. The second undercover officer has testified Schlatter said he was “arrested for something big,” Riva said, while the first testified Schlatter said he “did something big.” The officer stood by what he remembered. Riva suggested that the officer participated more actively in the conversation than he claimed, showing the jury a soundless video clip of the conversation that the public was not permitted to view because the officer’s identity is under a publication ban. The officer testified that his role, by law, was to listen and sometimes guide the conversation but all the conversation topics were prompted by Schlatter. He said his objective was to get any information about the homicide investigation, whether it was good or bad for Schlatter.

The attorney general could revoke or suspend the department’s access to the database, called CalGang. It is a statewide criminal intelligence compilation of 80,000 gang members and associates statewide used by local, state, federal and tribal law enforcement agencies to share information. It is used by the Los Angeles Police Department more than any other agency and at least 20 members of the department’s Metropolitan Division are under investigation after authorities found inaccuracies on field interview cards that police officers fill out after stopping and questioning people. The department has presented the case to Los Angeles County prosecutors for possible criminal charges. Becerra said authorities still do not know how many innocent people were erroneously listed as gang members in the database and declined comment when asked if other agencies are also being investigated. False or inaccurate data contaminates a system that is reliant on the integrity of its data, he said. While Becerra said the database is used as an intelligence-gathering tool, gang sentencing enhancements increase penalties in criminal cases. A critical state audit in 2016 found that the long-troubled database lacked oversight and that some agencies could not substantiate some of the listings. Becerra, whose office was granted oversight of the database the following year, said officials are working on additional reforms to the system. The attorney general’s office plans to audit the police department’s CalGang entries beyond those entered by Metropolitan Division members. Authorities will also review body camera video, including footage of police interactions with people who were characterized as gang members in the database. And officials will review the department’s accountability policies and observe the re-training of officers who use the database. Police Chief Michel Moore has recommended that one Metropolitan Division officer, whose name has not been made public, be fired. The officer will face an internal administrative tribunal and two others are suspended. Becerra said the police department did not inform the attorney general’s office of its probe until after media reports surfaced. The department has promised to investigate the alleged misuse and institute reforms. “The California Gang Database is a critical tool for law enforcement in its efforts to solve violent crime and any information entered must be accurate,“ Moore said in a statement after Becerra spoke with reporters. “We are committed to holding anyone who falsified information accountable and will also fully co-operate with the State Attorney General office.” The Los Angeles Police Protective League’s board of directors, the union that represents the department’s rank-and-file officers, said in a statement that it supports increased transparency for the database and praised the additional training. NBC Los Angeles first reported the investigation. The months-long probe began in early 2019 when a mother from the San Fernando Valley in the metro Los Angeles area reported that her son had been inaccurately identified as a gang member. Officials then discovered inaccuracies in documents about her son. The Metropolitan Division fields special suppression units in high-crime areas. Among other things, officers stop some drivers to search for guns and drugs. A Los Angeles Times analysis published last January concluded that from 2015 to 2018, 65% of drivers stopped by Metropolitan Division officers were African American.

Police say Tesfaye Asefa was reported missing from the unspecified facility on Jan. 27 and was located on Sunday. The force is thanking the public for helping in the search. Police say Asefa has been held at the hospital since he was found not criminally responsible for two counts of sexual assault in 2011. It’s not the first time he has vanished from the area: similar incidents were reported in August 2018 and May 2019.

Clearview AI, a U.S. company that provides artificial intelligence-powered facial recognition tools to law enforcement agencies, has been called “reckless,” “invasive,” and “dystopian” by critics. It identifies people by scanning for matches in its database of billions of images scraped from the open web, including social media sites, providing vastly greater search powers than other known facial recognition tools. “Some members of the Toronto Police Service began using Clearview AI in October 2019 with the intent of informally testing this new and evolving technology,” said TPS spokesperson Meaghan Gray. “The chief directed that its use be halted immediately upon his awareness, and the order to cease using the product was given on Feb. 5, 2020.” Gray said the Toronto Police Service has requested that Ontario’s Information and Privacy Commissioner and the Crown Attorney’s Office work with the force to review the technology’s appropriateness as a tool for law enforcement, “given that it is also used by other law enforcement agencies in North America.” “Until a fulsome review of the product is completed, it will not be used by the Toronto Police Service,” she said Thursday. A front-page New York Times story published in January first drew scrutiny to the previously little-known company’s broad powers and impacts on privacy. The report detailed how the company claims to have a database of over 3 billion images scraped from Facebook, YouTube and millions of other websites. Law enforcement officials who use Clearview AI can run an image of a person against this massive database, pulling up matches collected from across the web. People who have asked to try the technology on themselves pulled up images they didn’t know were online or had never seen before. Last May, when the Star first revealed that Toronto police were using facial recognition technology, the force said their tool only searched for matches in its own internal database of lawfully acquired mugshots. At the time, Staff Insp. Stephen Harris of Forensic Identification Services said “there are no plans to expand the TPS’s use of facial recognition beyond our current mugshot database. We are not judicially authorized to do so.” Toronto police did not respond to further questions Thursday, including whether officers were judicially authorized to use Clearview AI, whether it had been used in investigations or arrests, and how chief Saunders was not aware of its use. Brenda McPhail, director of the privacy, technology, and surveillance project at the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, called Toronto police’s use of Clearview AI “a remarkable violation of public trust.” “Clearview AI collects images of people without consent, in violation of the terms of service of the platforms people trust to protect their information — arguably, illegally — and no police force in Canada should be using technology whose lawfulness is open to question,” McPhail said. “This company allegedly has developed its entire facial recognition system by illegitimately if not illegally scraping images from the public internet,” says Chris Parsons,a senior research associate at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab. If Toronto police or any other Canadian law enforcement agency did that directly, “it would be radically afoul of Canadian privacy legislation. Using services produced by companies predicated on violations of Canadian law seems like an inappropriate technology to adopt,” says Parsons.

I’m not aware that she’s asked me to have a sit-down meeting. I’m certainly happy to do that,” the attorney general said. On Feb. 7, Mandhane noted in a letter to Downey that “despite multiple requests,” he has not met with her since becoming attorney general last June. Mandhane also said she was concerned that Downey’s failure to affirm an agreement signed by his predecessor, Caroline Mulroney, might compromise the commission’s “autonomy and independence from government and could result in Ontario failing to meet established international standards for human rights institutions.” Asked Thursday whether the commission should be an independent office, Downey said, “It has to be. I don’t think there’s any question about that.” As first revealed by the Star, Premier Doug Ford quietly appointed an active-duty Toronto police officer and a professor with Progressive Conservative links to sit on the commission last month. The appointments were made despite the fact that neither Const. Randall Arsenault nor Violetta Igneski, a McMaster University associate professor in philosophy, were among 330 applications submitted to Mandhane for vetting. The part-time appointments pay up to $10,000 a year. They were made amid the commission’s ongoing inquiry into allegations of racial profiling and discrimination against the Toronto Police Service, raising question of conflict of interest. In September 2018, Arsenault posted a picture on Instagram of himself and his partner in their uniforms with Ford at the annual Ford Fest picnic in Vaughan. In the caption, he wrote that police officers “have been taking photos with politicians in all levels of government and all political parties for quite some time now. I was proud to stand beside our Premier Doug Ford.” Igneski’s sister, Jasmine, held senior posts in the Tory governments of premier Mike Harris and prime minister Stephen Harper.

The 24-year-old woman was riding the 75 Sherbourne near Bloor Street West around 2:30 p.m. last Friday when a man began insulting her over her decision to wear a mask, police say. The woman tried to take a photo of the man, who grabbed her as he tried to pull the camera away from her. Police are looking for the man, believed to be in his 40s.

A few patrons are perched on stools, while men linger along the edge of the bar – some chat while others flirt, scanning the room. A familiar scene in a place where many have connected with friends, lovers, and strangers for decades. Convicted serial killer Bruce McArthur was once a face in this crowd. A presence at the bar, whether on a stool or out on the shaded patio, his parked van a familiar sight to those of us who spent time here during those years. Following his arrest, some would share stories, vague memories of him —or someone like him —on the periphery of a dance party or night out, a wolf circling the flock, waiting to pounce. “What if I had gone home with him?” I remember a friend saying in the days following the arrest. “He looked like so many guys at the bar.” The truth is far more complicated, of course, especially when assessed now, two years since his arrest and the year since he pleaded guilty to the murders of eight men. But what is the legacy of this tragedy and has anything changed? McArthur was a predator, but his methods were largely motivated by convenience. His appearance benign enough to avoid scrutiny, his victims were invisible within the larger community and subject to discrimination because of race, sexuality, and economic hardship – often a combination of all three. His attraction to marginalized men was directly related to the ease by which he could make those same individuals disappear, a growing collection of missing posters that would be largely ignored. “I think what the case did was shine a light on the danger of racism within the LGBTQ community,” says Haran Vijayanathan, outgoing executive director of the Alliance for South Asian AIDS Prevention, and an advocate for McArthur’s victims and their families. “It showed that people can go missing and their absence can be ignored when we only see things from one specific lens.” Those within law enforcement also made assumptions about the whereabouts of the men, attributing their disappearances to double lives and precarious housing, disregarding McArthur’s ties to many of the victims and a history of violent behaviour. His eventual arrest after months of public denials only made things worse – creating a deep fissure between Toronto’s LGBTQ community and the police, and further building on the accusations of systemic neglect and abuse made by groups like Black Lives Matter. “I think that the mistrust and collective trauma response that the community has in the presence of police is completely warranted,” says Jaymie Sampa, manager of Program and Partnership Development at The 519, a community centre serving the Church and Wellesley neighbourhood. “What other outcome could there be in the face of such a fractured history?” In the aftermath of the case, many organizations looked to alternative methods to address concerns around community safety. The 519 expanded their anti-violence programming, creating resources designed to reinforce informal networks between marginalized individuals, as well as offering self-defense classes, group therapy, and drop-in counselling for those navigating grief. “Don’t get me wrong, we absolutely rely on the institution of policing —but we’ve learned that you can’t strictly rely on them,” continues Sampa. “There are so many informal ways that our community has kept itself safe for decades, and those methods are not going anywhere.” Vijayanathan spearheaded ASAAP’s Safe Program, a service that allows those without a network or fearful of discrimination to email their contact information to the organization prior to an anonymous sexual encounter with the promise of follow-up. “If the person is still not responding to emails or calls within 24 hours, we will go to the police,” he says. “It just creates an additional resource and sense that someone in the world is watching out for you.” The case also motivated institutional changes. Toronto Police Service implemented the Neighbourhood Pilot Project, a program which deploys officers to a community for a four-year term, with specific training designed to improve communication and build familiarity between law enforcement and a neighbourhood’s citizens. Vijayanathan says the Church-Wellesley leg has been successful enough to lead to roll outs in other areas of the city. “It’s great to see the police stepping up,” he says. “Mind you, that relationship is never going to be 100 per cent, but they are making more active attempts to engage the community.” The police also announced the long-overdue creation of a Missing Persons Unit in July 2018, a subsection of the Homicide unit that ensures the “consistent process and investigative response to all occurrences of missing persons in the city.” But many still feel that this renewed interest isn’t enough. “Four community officers do not change an institution with deep-seated beliefs and where power has been misused to further disenfranchise people,” says Sampa. “Racism is still alive and well in our city, and there are kids who sleep on our porch because it’s the only place they feel safe. That hasn’t changed in the last two years.” Requests to speak to the Toronto Police for this story were not granted. Retired Ontario justice Gloria Epstein is heading up an independent review into how the police service has handled missing person cases, including those associated with the McArthur case, with her findings due in January 2021. Vijayanathan is on the advisory council, and says his role is to ensure that the review engages the broadest spectrum of community members as possible.

That there are men of colour who experience poverty, but also mental health issues, homelessness, addiction, complicated sexual identities —and ensuring that these factors are taken into consideration by the system to better to protect everyone in the community.” Still, Vijayanathan feels that even with these resources, the community – those in the bars and out on the scene – need to do more to protect each other and recognize this is an ongoing issue. “Just because [McArthur] is in jail doesn’t mean there aren’t other serial killers out there. It’s important to remain vigilant. We need to be mindful that, yes, we’re in Canada, we’re a safe country, and that’s great.” “But there are cracks in our system and unfortunately it’ll always be the most marginalized that fall through.”\", 'https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2020/02/14/peel-and-halton-police-reveal-they-too-used-controversial-facial-recognition-tool.html': \"One day after the revelation Toronto police tested a controversial facial recognition technology, two more Greater Toronto Area police services have revealed they have also used the U.S.-based Clearview AI investigative tool. Officers in Peel and Halton regions confirmed to the Star Friday that they ran tests of the highly divisive artificial intelligence-powered facial recognition tool. Both have stopped using the technology. Halton Regional Police confirmed it began a “free trial” of the tool in October 2019. It has since stopped and an internal evaluation is underway. Unlike Toronto police Chief Mark Saunders — who was apparently unaware his officers were testing the tool, and ordered them to stop once he learned they were — Halton Chief Stephen Tanner confirmed in an email Friday he knew his officers “were doing a pilot project with facial recognition software of some type.” A Peel Regional Police spokesperson Sgt. Joe Cardi confirmed Friday that a “demo product of the Clearview AI software” was provided to the service for testing purposes only. Peel police Chief Nishan Duraiappah has since directed that testing “cease until a full assessment is undertaken pursuant to a concurrent ongoing facial recognition review project.” “Our review team is working closely with the Information and Privacy Commissioner’s Office as well as other police organizations to ensure any future application of facial recognition technology is in keeping with privacy legislation, guidelines and contemporary standards,” Cardi said. “The Clearview AI technology was never used in any active investigations,” Cardi said. “The direction was made on Jan. 27 2020 to cease any active testing.” Spokesperson Const. Ryan Anderson said Halton police is also not making any decisions regarding future use of the application pending the review by the Ontario Information and Privacy Commissioner and the Ministry of the Attorney General. In a statement, Ontario’s Information and Privacy Commissioner Brian Beamish “urged” organizations to contact the office “if they are considering using new technologies that could pose a potential privacy risk to citizens.” After the Star informed Beamish’s office that other Ontario police services had tested the tool, Beamish said Friday afternoon that they should “stop this practice immediately and contact my office.” “I’ve also asked my staff to contact those we’ve become aware of through the media to discuss the legality and privacy implications of their use of this technology,” he said. Beamish’s office was unaware Toronto police were using Clearview AI technology until contacted by them last week. Noting there are “vital privacy issues at stake with the use of any facial recognition technology,” Beamish said “we are relieved that its use has been halted.” “We question whether there are any circumstances where it would be acceptable to use Clearview AI,” he said. Called “reckless” by critics, the much-criticized Clearview AI technology uses a database of billions of images scraped from the open web — including social media sites — and identifies people by scanning for matches. The company’s law enforcement tool first came to light in a New York Times story last month. The technology can be used by police to run an image of a person — a suspect, person of interest or possible victim — against this vast database, finding matches in images that have been drawn from across the web. Previously, the Toronto police told the Star it was only judicially authorized to use facial recognition technology to search for matches in its internal mugshot database. Clearview AI did not respond to a series of questions from the Star, including whether the company had approached Canadian police services to offer a free trial, and if so, when. The company also did not respond to a question about the identity of an officer behind a testimonial on the company’s website. The cop is identified only as a “detective constable in the Sex Crimes Unit” of a Canadian police service. “Clearview is hands-down the best thing that has happened to victim identification in the last 10 years. Within a week and a half of using Clearview, [we] made eight identifications of either victims or offenders through the use of this new tool,” the officer is quoted as saying on Clearview AI’s website. Toronto police revealed Thursday that its officers began “informally testing” Clearview AI in October 2019. Once Saunders learned about this, he ordered them to stop, Toronto police spokesperson Meaghan Gray said Thursday. Ontario’s Information and Privacy Commissioner and the Crown Attorney’s Office have been asked by Toronto police to review the technology’s appropriateness, Gray said. “At no time was the Clearview AI technology used for livestreaming or real-time information gathering and there were no costs associated with its use,” Gray said in an email Friday. “Our current review includes a comprehensive analysis of each time the technology was accessed by an investigator,” she added. It’s unclear whether any arrests were made as a result of Toronto police officers’ use of the technology.

Not just to snap a photo and mail a ticket to red-light running scofflaws but to help reduce this dangerous driving behaviour, the city says. So much so that Toronto actually brought in less revenue than it expected last year from its red-light cameras, at least in part because of the improved compliance of drivers. That’s great. In a city that’s constantly facing needless pedestrian deaths, news that at least some intersections are getting safer is worth a moment of celebration. If ticketing more drivers who run red lights has resulted in significant reductions in collisions, injuries and deaths, then surely ticketing more drivers for speeding, distracted driving or blowing through stop signs would also help make roads safer. Yet Toronto police handed out fewer traffic offences tickets last year than any time in the past decade. According to city records, police laid 200,788 provincial offence charges (the bulk of which are traffic-related) in 2019. That’s down from nearly 700,000 in 2010. That steep decline is certainly not because drivers have suddenly become that much more law-abiding. Anyone who regularly walks, bikes or drives in Toronto knows how rare it is to make it through even a single day without seeing examples of dangerous and distracted driving and a close call or two. Pedestrian deaths have more than doubled from 2010 to 2019. There were 42 last year. The decline in tickets is largely a result of Toronto police disbanding their dedicated traffic enforcement unit in 2013 and the rest of the force being told that traffic enforcement is just “a supplemental role” to their main duties of policing. Treating traffic enforcement so casually makes no sense given its deadly consequences. Pedestrian deaths in Toronto are now about on par with shooting deaths. Dangerous driving demands far more attention than police have given it in recent years, and more than the newly created traffic enforcement squad of a paltry six officers and two supervisors will be able to deliver. The new Toronto police shift schedule, which is supposed to give frontline officers more time for proactive policing, holds a little more promise for seeing increased traffic enforcement. But it’s troubling that, despite all the evidence of the need for more traffic enforcement, Chief Mark Saunders continues to look away. He says the decline in traffic enforcement and tickets can’t possibly be connected to the rise in collisions and pedestrians deaths. When asked about the correlation last week by councillor Michael Thompson, Saunders called it “not an accurate assumption.” And yet a report Saunders sent to council late last year clearly demonstrates what a difference enforcement makes. “It has been well documented through numerous studies that enforcement is a key component to achieving a reduction in deaths and injuries caused through preventable collisions and poor driving behaviour,” the report states. Between 2003 and 2012, when Toronto police had a dedicated traffic unit and traffic officers were visible and proactive, they “were effective in changing behaviour.” It seems clear that the Toronto Police Service is hoping that automation will take over the mundane work of ticketing drivers who flout the law.

Until then, police need to start treating traffic safety in Toronto as the deadly serious business that it is.\", 'https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2020/02/18/toronto-police-board-to-mull-donation-to-purchase-new-armoured-vehicle.html': \"The Toronto police board is set to debate whether to accept a private donation for the purchase of a new armoured vehicle, the Star has learned — controversial machinery typically used by the military but increasingly obtained by municipal forces. The proposed gift is expected to be debated at the Toronto Police Services Board meeting later this month, according to a source with knowledge of the donation who was not authorized to speak on the record. Toronto police spokesperson Allison Sparkes confirmed to the Star that the force is requesting the board review a proposal for a new armoured vehicle but would not say who has offered to make the donation that would make it possible. That information is expected to be made public by the police board on Tuesday, Sparkes said in response to questions sent by the Star on Monday. If the donation is approved, the new machinery would replace the service’s 14-year-old armoured vehicle, which cannot be maintained or refurbished because the manufacturer is out of business, Sparkes said. But the proposed acquisition has critics worried about creeping “militarization” — particularly given technological advancements made in the years since Toronto police obtained their last vehicle. “There’s a whole trend of greater weaponization of the service without a single, solid, well-researched, independently verified business case that justifies these things,” said Alok Mukherjee, who was the chair of the Toronto police board from 2005 to 2015. He referenced the recent move to equip more officers with Tasers and last week’s revelation that Toronto police tested controversial facial recognition technology. “This is hugely disturbing — but at the same time it’s consistent with the direction in which Toronto police have been moving,” he said. Sparkes said the armoured vehicle is used by the service’s tactical unit, the Emergency Task Force. Given its mandate to respond to dynamic public safety situations, she said that having “the most up-to-date technology and equipment is critical.” As required by its donation policy, any gift worth more than $10,000 must be approved by the Toronto police board. The cost of a new armoured vehicle varies, but they retail in the hundreds of thousands of dollars; after a heated debate last year, Halifax city council approved the purchase of an armoured vehicle for $500,000. Within the last decade, a growing number of municipal police services in Canada have either acquired — via the military — or purchased their own armoured vehicles, said Kevin Walby, an assistant professor of criminal justice at the University of Winnipeg whose research includes police equipment and tactical “SWAT” teams. The police forces that have armoured vehicles in their fleets include Montreal, Halton region, Hamilton, Winnipeg and Waterloo. But despite their growing popularity, Walby said the utility of armoured vehicles is limited. “A lot of times a SWAT team needs to enter a space quickly and with stealth. If they are serving a warrant, expecting return fire, they don’t want to be pulling up with a big clunky vehicle with ‘Police’ on it,” he said. Walby noted there is pressure for police services to obtain new tools and technology, both because of a “keeping up with the Joneses” effect — if other services have certain equipment, a force may feel it needs the same — as well as the fact that armoured vehicles are becoming a “big industry in Canada.” “We have these companies that specialize in armoured personnel and vehicles, (and) they traditionally did this for militaries but now they are morphing into these entities that sell to municipal police,” Walby said, noting companies attend police technology conferences and “are the biggest display on the floor.” Police services themselves say the equipment is used in high-risk situations, including dangerous arrests, standoffs and conflicts with a suspect who has a weapon. York Regional Police have owned an armoured vehicle for the past 10 years. Const. Laura Nicolle, a York police spokesperson, said the vehicle is often used as protection for officers and paramedics working during an incident. “One of its primary functions would be for retrieval or rescue of victims from an active/unsafe situation,” she said in an email.

While large corporate donations must be disclosed to the public and approved by the Toronto police services board, experts say the civilian board must carefully scrutinize the proposed gift at its upcoming meeting, due to concerns about possible undue influence and perceptions of bias. “I think we need to be very careful about private entities providing a donation to the police,” said Akwasi Owusu-Bempah, an assistant professor of criminology at the University of Toronto who researches policing. “It’s precisely for the same reason that we don’t want political interests driving police priorities, we also don’t want private sector interests unduly driving police priorities,” said Christian Leuprecht, a policing and technology expert affiliated with Royal Military College of Canada and Queen’s University. Interior Systems Contractors Association of Ontario (ISCA) approached Toronto police to provide the bulk of the cash necessary to replace what Toronto police chief Mark Saunders called its “outdated” 14-year-old armoured vehicle. Military-style machines like it have increasingly been used by municipal forces in recent years. According to a statement from ISCA, a construction employers’ association with more than 100 member businesses, the donation is in line with its “long history of philanthropic support of community endeavours.” “Upon learning that the Toronto Police Service’s (Emergency Task Force) was in need of a new armoured rescue vehicle to replace an ageing and less capable similar vehicle, the volunteer board of ISCA agreed that this was in keeping with the giving spirit and sense of community beneficence that has defined ISCA for decades,” read a statement from executive director Ron Johnson. According to Saunders’ report, the donation is in accordance with both the Toronto police board procedure and the City of Toronto donation policy allowing “voluntary donations for community benefits.” The chief’s report said Toronto police has confirmed that ISCA “is not currently engaged in, nor are any of its registered contractor members currently engaged in, active City or Service procurements as bidders, proponents or applicants.” In his report to the Toronto police board, Saunders said the service’s current armoured vehicle poses officer safety issues, including a lack of air filter or ventilation capabilities. “The new armoured rescue police vehicles have been designed with greater surveillance and officer safety capabilities,” his report states. According to Saunders’ three-page report, the association approached Toronto police to fund the purchase of a new armoured vehicle after ISCA executive staff attended the ETF facility for a tour. The proposed donation of $275,000 will cover the bulk of the estimated $300,000 required to buy a new vehicle; the remaining $25,000 will require a change to the Toronto police service’s 2020 operating budget, the report says. Saunders said Toronto police cannot simply refurbish their current armoured vehicle because the manufacturer is out of business. Potential conflict-of-interest dilemmas such as this underscore the importance of independent police oversight, Leuprecht said. The board’s decision will be closely watched, he said, in part because as Canada’s largest municipal police board, Toronto police is often perceived as a trailblazer and the decision “sets the precedent.” Leuprecht stressed the importance of effective communication from the board to explain the complex issues at hand, including why they are entertaining this and why it may be necessary.

Planned disruption has been mounting across Canada as part of a growing movement, rooted in opposition to a major pipeline project that would cross the traditional territory of the Wet’suwet’en Nation in northern British Columbia. It has resulted in the shutting down of rail lines and temporary impasses this weekend at two bridges on the U.S. border, leaving Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government scrambling to find a resolution. Toronto’s event began at Christie Pits Park at about 3 p.m. A throng of more than 1,000 demonstrators, some walking with the “Families for Wet’suwet’en” group, moved in a slow procession along Bloor Street to Bay Street, south to College Street and then to Queen’s Park. The walk was led by a line of people singing and playing drums, and backed by a second group carrying a broad black banner with the words “Families for Wet’suwet’en.” At each intersection, the group paused, cheering and singing. Demonstrators carried placards bearing statements such as “No Consent, No Pipelines,” and chanted, “When justice fails block the rails. Shut Canada down,” and “How do you spell racist? R-C-M-P.” On arrival, at the south side of the legislative building, the crowd formed a circle as people spoke in opposition to the pipeline and in support of Indigenous rights. Between statements, music and song continued. Prayers were offered and some members joined hands and took part in a round dance. At other moments, a sense of palpable anger and frustration rose from the crowd, as they called on the federal government to respect hereditary land rights. At Queen’s Park, one speaker read a statement from Eve Saint, one of four people arrested at the Gidimt’en checkpoint in B.C. on Feb. 7 after a dramatic encounter with officers pointing rifles and group members pleading with them not to shoot, according to reporting and a video posted by the CBC. Daughter of the hereditary chief of that territory, Saint described a scene that included officers in tactical gear, dropping from helicopters and holding rifles.“The thought of being shot replayed in my mind and I repeatedly yelled to RCMP, ‘We are unarmed and peaceful. Don’t shoot.’” Saint thanked supporters and encouraged them to “keep using your voice” and power. “This is what it looks like for Indigenous land defenders on their own territories in 2020. We need to keep up this momentum. It is with unity with Wet’suwet’en, but it is also about Indigenous rights everywhere,” Saint wrote. “Keep using your voice, your power to shut down Canada.” Toronto police were assisting the “safe movement” of the demonstration, Const.

In Ottawa, Trudeau held an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss blockades. “I understand how worrisome this is for so many Canadians and difficult for many people and families across the country,” Trudeau said. “We’re going to continue to focus on resolving the situation quickly and peacefully.” A similar protest was staged in Niagara Falls on Sunday. A smaller rally took place there, as protesters temporarily blocked traffic at the Rainbow International Bridge. The rally created long lineups of cars at the bridge.

Protesters also blocked access to the Thousand Islands Bridge near Kingston, Ont., a border crossing, for roughly three hours. Ontario Provincial Police urged those planning to cross to the U.S. to find other routes in order to avoid the group. The nationwide protests and blockades have brought freight rail shipping to a halt in areas, and led to Via Rail stopping passenger trains, all with an economic impact of millions of dollars.

Toronto police issued a news release last week with a photo of a man taken on the bus as part of their investigation.

It’s not clear why she was wearing the mask and police wouldn’t say whether they believe the incident was racially motivated, saying they didn’t want to release any information about the victim. There have been an increase in the number of people wearing masks on the streets of Toronto over fears of the novel coronavirus epidemic in China. Canadian health officials say that wearing surgical masks during everyday life has little use in protecting against coronavirus, despite being effective in hospital settings.

The recommendations were contained in a report on the city of Toronto’s response to the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, released last summer. The federal inquiry included 231 “calls for justice” — 100 of them relevant in some way to city governments. While Toronto provides programs and services to its Indigenous population, important steps need to be taken in order to fulfil the recommendations that arose from the federal inquiry, according to the city report. “We did hear that Toronto is the best city for services and I’m proud of that and I know it to be true,” said Mandy Wesley, the city’s consultant on Toronto’s role in implementing the calls for justice that arose from the MMIWG inquiry. Wesley and Lauren Kimura, of the city’s Indigenous Affairs Office, presented the findings to the city’s Aboriginal Affairs Advisory Committee on Feb. 11. “Nowhere in Canada are there as many direct Indigenous-led, Indigenous-delivered services for Indigenous peoples.” The problem is that funding isn’t always reliable and can be difficult to access. “There is a lack of long-term commitment coupled with insufficient resources and the autonomy to deliver the programs and services in a way that is culturally appropriate,” according to the draft report, which also pointed out that qualifying requirements are time-consuming and rigid. “These programs need funding from the city, but funding also requires so much paperwork for such a little amount of money and they micromanage what you’re doing with the money,” according to Frances Sanderson, executive director of Nishnawbe Homes and one of the experts consulted for the report. The report also points to the inconsistency of services, including the Toronto Police Service’s Aboriginal Peacekeeping Unit, established in 1992. At the time of its inception, when the Indigenous population was .4 per cent of the city, the unit had five dedicated police officers. According to estimates from the city of Toronto, the city’s Indigenous population is now three per cent, and Toronto police have one officer assigned to the unit, according to the report. Toronto police spokesperson Meaghan Gray confirmed the service currently has one police officer and one administrator working in the APU, but said 10 officers communicate with and help the unit. “The unit, despite a reduction in numbers due to attrition, has expanded its mandate, outreach efforts and community partnerships,” Gray said. Both public servants and Toronto police need to receive more Indigenous Cultural Training, specifically from the point of view of Indigenous women and girls and two-spirited people (those who identify as having both a masculine and feminine spirit), according to the report. “We talk about this epidemic,” said Wesley, referring to the murder of Indigenous women and girls. “We know that at the crux, at the heart of it, is racism and systemic discrimination that permeates through institutions and through society.” Making others see the world through the lens of Indigenous women and girls is an essential tool in fighting that, Wesley said. Wesley said access to land for ceremonial healing is critical for Indigenous people.

British Columbia’s privacy commissioner and three of his counterparts are weighing whether to launch an investigation into the threat to Canadians’ rights posed by Clearview AI, the U.S. company that makes the app. Its search engine allows police to match an image of an unidentified person against what Clearview AI claims is a database of three billion images scraped from the open web, including social media sites. “I think it is very questionable whether it would conform with Canadian law,” said Michael McEvoy, British Columbia’s privacy commissioner. “We would have to have a closer look, and that’s something that Canadian privacy regulators collectively are considering right now.” The B.C. privacy commissioner is one of four in Canada with jurisdiction to investigate how private businesses collect, use and disclose personal information. The others are the federal privacy commissioner and those in Alberta and Quebec. Ontario falls under the federal private-sector privacy law. The laws these offices enforce share a bedrock principle: businesses must obtain individuals’ consent before collecting, using or disclosing personal information, with narrow exceptions. If personal information is used for a purpose other than the one for which it was originally collected, consent must be obtained again. “The intent here is to give individuals the right to have some sense and modicum of control over their own information. And of course, what could be more personal to somebody than their own image?” McEvoy asked. He questioned whether Clearview AI — if its database really does contain billions of images of individuals scraped off the web without permission — meets those legal standards. McEvoy added that the four regulators have “recently” discussed the matter because the technology has the potential to impact so many Canadians. “People should be allowed to go about their business, their life, without being under a state of constant surveillance. I don’t think Canadians want to live in that kind of society.” Clearview AI did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. On its website, the company says the facial recognition tool is available to law enforcement agencies and “select security professionals.” It says the app is not available to the public. “Clearview’s image search technology has been independently tested for accuracy and evaluated for legal compliance by nationally recognized authorities,” the website claims, without elaborating further on what authorities it is referring to. Toronto, Halton Region and Peel Region police forces all confirmed to the Star last week that they tested Clearview AI. Toronto’s police chief was unaware the app was being used; Halton’s chief said he did know. All have since stopped using it, according to spokespersons. The RCMP and Ontario Provincial Police would not reveal whether they have used Clearview AI. Christian Leuprecht, a policing and technology expert affiliated with Royal Military College of Canada and Queen’s University, agreed that Clearview AI likely contravenes Canadian law by the way it scrapes the pictures — and that a Canadian citizen’s reasonable expectation of privacy has “very likely been violated in the process here.” Because of that, law enforcement’s use of Clearview AI might jeopardize the prosecution of criminal cases. “There’s a high risk that if they either introduce that evidence or it turns out that that evidence was a determinant in the way the case ended up evolving, that that would be turfed from court and the entire case could collapse,” Leuprecht said. It’s not known whether the use of Clearview AI directly resulted in any arrests. In Peel Region, a spokesperson said the technology was never used on an active investigation, while in Halton, a spokesperson did not respond to the Star’s questions about whether arrests were made as a result of the force’s use of the tool.

But the revelation that local police have been testing the technology has left criminal lawyers wondering what the implications could be for their clients. Jill Presser, who co-chairs the Criminal Lawyers Association’s committee on law and technology, said she’s unclear what, if any, obligations Crown prosecutors would have to disclose evidence of the use of Clearview AI in court. “Particularly if the tool is one of a number of investigative tools used and it isn’t essential to a narrative of how the investigation unfolded, we may never know,” she said. “That’s a major part of what’s so troubling.” RELATED STORIESGTAToronto police chief halts use of controversial facial recognition toolFeb. 13, 2020GTAPeel and Halton police reveal they too used controversial facial recognition toolFeb. 14, 2020GTA4 in 10 Torontonians do not trust police use of facial recognition tech but nearly half see crime-fighting potential, poll saysJun. 13, 2019 Ontario’s privacy commissioner, Brian Beamish, said he is reaching out directly to the Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police this week. “Until we have thoroughly reviewed Clearview AI and any other biometric solutions that have the potential to gather information about people who aren’t under any suspicion, police services must refrain from their use,” Beamish said in a statement. He added that he supports the use of technologies by police to enhance community safety — provided that they are used transparently and in a way that respects the privacy rights of citizens. “I would have serious concerns about a law enforcement service that used this kind of tool without fully considering the public interest — that means thorough privacy impact assessments, public consultation and full transparency about what kind of data is collected by the technology and how they propose to use it.” The federal privacy commissioner’s office said the RCMP has committed to consulting with it in advance of using any facial recognition technology, in the form of a privacy impact assessment. The RCMP “has not yet submitted” any such assessment, a spokesperson said. “Broadly speaking, our office has identified facial recognition as having the potential to be the most highly invasive of the current popular biometric identifying technologies. Faces have been transformed into electronic information that can be aggregated, analyzed and categorized in unprecedented ways.” Of the police forces in major municipalities that the Star contacted, spokespersons for forces in Vancouver, Edmonton, Halifax, Barrie, York Region and Niagara Region said they do not use Clearview AI.

Another clip played in court Thursday shows Schlatter walking back up the alley alone roughly 45 minutes later. Prosecutors asked the Toronto police detective who reviewed the footage whether he ever saw Richey emerge, or someone else going to or from the same area. “I did not,” Det. Stephen Matthews said, adding that he watched at least two more hours of footage that followed Schlatter’s departure. Matthews said he reviewed recordings from all the cameras around that location, including one that covered a fence line at the back. The cameras were motion-activated and sensitive enough to be triggered by bugs or shadows, he said. Schlatter has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder in Richey’s death. Prosecutors allege he sexually assaulted and strangled her in the hours after they met. Richey, 22, was reported missing after she failed to return from a night out with a friend. Her mother and a family friend discovered her body days later in a stairwell in the city’s gay village. Court has previously seen security footage from a club where Richey, her friend Ryley Simard and Schlatter were earlier in the night.

Rather than respond to questions about his testimony in the case, Det. Const. Daryl Gazey retired from the Toronto Police Service and travelled to Italy, Justice Anne London-Weinstein said in her decision Friday. Because Gazey is no longer an officer, he will not face an internal discipline investigation, Toronto police spokesperson Meaghan Gray said following the judge’s ruling. Gazey was an undercover officer and a key Crown witness meant to establish that Siavash Norouzian trafficked in heroin on two occasions in October 2013 and possessed $200 in proceeds of crime — the “buy money” from a police sting. During the May 2018 trial, Gazey testified he had arranged to buy heroin after receiving an anonymous Crime Stoppers tip that Norouzian was selling the drug. Gazey claimed he called Norouzian’s phone once, at 4:20 p.m. on Oct. 23, 2013, and spoke to a man with “strong, thick Middle Eastern accent,” then later that day received another call and “immediately recognized the voice.” But, London-Weinstein said, forensic evidence undermined that claim. The problem, she said, was that “the 4:20 p.m. call never happened.” “I found that the officer was not being honest with the court,” London-Weinstein said, appearing in a Toronto courtroom by video from Ottawa, where she now sits. The judge rejected the Crown’s submission that the officer was simply mistaken about the time of the call and that it wasn’t important anyway. She also cited other examples of Gazey’s evidence being contradicted by phone logs. For those reasons, London-Weinstein said she was unable to rely on his testimony about a hand-to-hand heroin transaction alleged to have taken place in a supermarket. “I found Detective Constable Gazey to be not credible as a witness,” she said. After Gazey’s testimony, the judge granted a defence request to reopen the case to question him about his statements. Despite being served a subpoena, “Gazey, whose credibility was so central in this case, never did return to trial,” the judge said. “Instead, he retired from the Toronto Police Service and travelled to Italy instead of returning to face questions regarding forensic phone evidence.” Therefore, she continued: “Many of the remaining questions surrounding the disparities between the forensic evidence versus the evidence of the officer remain unanswered.” While the judge said she found it was “probable” that Norouzian had some involvement in a trafficking operation, her “suspicions are not the test in law. I must be sure before I can find Mr. Norouzian guilty. Given my concerns about the credibility of Detective Constable Gazey, I am not satisfied that Mr. Norouzian is guilty.” Defence lawyer Greg Lafontaine, who represented Norouzian, said it’s rare for judges to say a police witness misled court and that they’ll only do so when it’s “clear as a bell,” adding that “no one should hold their breath about a followup investigation.” Gray, the police spokesperson, confirmed Gazey left Toronto police in August 2018, but declined to respond to Lafontaine’s comments, saying: “I can tell you that the Service is notified of any concerns regarding any member’s testimony through the Ministry of the Attorney General. When these concerns are brought to our attention, the matter is then reviewed by Professional Standards and, if appropriate, disciplinary action is taken.” RELATED STORIESGTABrampton judge dismisses cocaine charges over illegal RCMP wiretap, finds officer ‘falsely’ testified about affidavitJan. 16, 2020GTAJudge tosses drug evidence, finds Toronto cops were ‘ignorant’ of strip search lawSep. 20, 2017GTAJudge tosses Brampton drug case, slams Crown ‘negligence’ for disclosing ‘mountain’ of evidence on eve of trialJan. 19, 2019 Gazey could not be reached for comment.

Sean Sutton, who also arrested Norouzian. Sutton lost his notes about his role in this investigation — and failed to report that fact — and wrote an investigative report two years after Norouzian’s arrest, she said. The judge said her concerns about Sutton related to the reliability of his memory, not his credibility. During the trial, Lafontaine argued his client was merely an addict associating with his heroin supplier, who had pleaded guilty before the trial began.

Defence lawyers for Kalen Schlatter are raising questions about a man dressed in a hooded winter coat and light pink trucker hat who also appears in some security videos from the area where Tess Richey was last seen on Nov. 25, 2017. They are cross-examining a Toronto police homicide detective who reviewed hours of footage from a number of security cameras as part of the investigation into Richey’s death.

The investigation was initiated “in the wake of numerous media reports that have raised questions and concerns about whether the company is collecting and using personal information without consent,” according to a joint statement. The probe will be carried out by the privacy commissioners of Canada, Quebec, Alberta and British Columbia, which have jurisdiction over how businesses collect and use citizens’ private information. In the last week, Toronto police as well as the services in Peel, Halton and Durham regions, have all confirmed to the Star that they used Clearview AI, an app that allows officers to match pictures of unidentified people against what the U.S. company claims is a database of three billion images scraped off the web, including from social media sites. Chiefs at all four police departments have since ordered officers to stop using the app. The OPP and the RCMP would not reveal whether they had also used Clearview AI. In an emailed statement, Tor Ekeland, lawyer for Clearview AI, said the tool “only accesses publicly available data from the public internet.” The app is “is strictly an after-the-fact investigative tool for law enforcement, and is used to solve crimes including murder, rape and child exploitation. We’ve received the letter and look forward to a productive dialogue with Canadian officials,” Ekeland’s statement said. Ontario’s privacy commissioner said Thursday that he and his counterparts across the country are at “the formative stages” of creating guidance for use of biometric technologies, including facial recognition. “The potential privacy dangers of facial recognition have really come to a head around the Clearview AI application,” Brian Beamish told the Star. “I think we all understand that there are some legitimate law enforcement uses for biometrics and even facial recognition. But I think we have to be really careful about going down that road.” Beamish said he is also writing this week to the Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police, with the message that “they should be telling their membership that if they’re using Clearview, they should stop.” Independent experts and the privacy watchdogs themselves have argued that their enforcement powers are woefully inadequate for the massive challenges that modern technology represents — and in particular, artificial intelligence. “One of the things that is important for Canadian authorities to have is some kind of proper monetary penalty that can be put in place to deter the bad guys. We don’t have that in Canada, anywhere,” British Columbia privacy commissioner Michael McEvoy told the Star on Wednesday. McEvoy noted that the federal privacy commissioner doesn’t have the power to issue orders against companies that run afoul of the law. “That is, in this day and age, absolutely ludicrous in my opinion,” he said.

That Toronto police seemingly advocate both for and against increased enforcement is hardly proof positive of anything. That fatalities have increased far less than tickets issued have decreased indicates a less direct correlation between the two than the Star is suggesting. You ignore population growth, changing densities with new condos, increased traffic and transit congestion, altered commuting patterns, different pedestrian and cycling volumes and myriad other potential factors. What we need is data, so that evidence points us toward the most effective remedies. You are doing the public a disservice in this editorial by jumping to conclusions without first having a thorough understanding of the situation. While much concern focuses on the decrease in revenue resulting from a dramatic decline in the number of traffic tickets being issued by the Toronto Police Service, the real danger is an inevitable lack of respect for the law. When drivers discover a reduced likelihood of being charged for driving infractions, an insidious and progressive pattern of negative driving habits is certain to occur. There is considerable street-level evidence that this dangerous process has already begun. It comes as no surprise that the number of tickets issued by our police force has dropped significantly in the past few years. Police have seemingly become almost invisible on our streets. As a result many drivers have developed a cavalier attitude toward obeying our traffic laws — driving through red lights, ignoring stop signs, not using turn signals, etc.', 'https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2020/02/22/police-chiefs-say-facial-recognition-needs-more-review-but-cops-should-be-able-to-use-ai.html': \"The chiefs of two Greater Toronto Area police forces now slamming the brakes on the use of a contentious facial recognition tool admit the app should have undergone greater scrutiny before it was tested by their investigators. Clearview AI, a U.S.-based app providing an artificial intelligence-powered tool to law enforcement agencies, “clearly” deserves “a lot more thought and scrutiny,” Peel Regional Police chief Nishan Duraiappah told the Star in a sit-down interview Friday, the same day federal and provincial regulators launched an investigation into the potentially illegal tool. Both Duraiappah and Halton Regional Police chief Stephen Tanner say the tool was first introduced sometime last fall to investigators from their respective Internet Child Exploitation (ICE) units. The officers were attending a professional development event, both chiefs say — a gathering that typically sees officers from different forces swapping tools and techniques and includes law enforcement product vendors. Billed as a database of more than 3 billion images scraped from Facebook, YouTube and millions of other websites, the app’s ability to match an image of an unidentified person caught the attention of ICE investigators, each one of whom “just lives and breathes identifying children that have been exploited,” Duraiappah said. “We can’t be the gatekeeper of every conference that we go to,” Duraiappah said. “I can see how an officer got a test licence and said, ‘Hey, this sounds interesting. Could it be useful to our work?’” Nonetheless, when he learned in January that officers were testing the technology, Duraiappah — like police chiefs in Toronto and Durham Region — immediately halted its use in light of mounting concerns about inherent privacy concerns. Speaking to the Star  this week, Tanner agreed that in hindsight, greater evaluation was needed before his Halton officers tested the tool. “I would say we — I or we — could have done more background checking into it before we implemented any pilot projects,” he said. Unlike other chiefs, Tanner did not initially stop his officers from using the tool when he learned they were testing it, because he believed it was fair game to use an app using images scraped from the open web, he said. “Clearview is just a name — I don’t know what Clearview is, really. I’ve read a little bit about it in the last few days,” he said. But while both chiefs acknowledge the need for a thorough review of Clearview AI, they stress that when used appropriately, facial recognition technology boasts dramatic potential to speed up investigations, identify victims of child pornography, link crimes across geographic regions, and more. “There’s gotta be a space for us to use AI (artificial intelligence),” said Duraiappah. “I’m trying to be sensitive, but also not lose the narrative about how this could be good for us.” Clearview AI’s database of images may violate laws protecting Canadians against businesses collecting personal information, including photos posted online, without their consent. The investigation launched Friday by privacy commissioners of Canada, Quebec, Alberta and British Columbia is seeking to clarify the issue. In an email Friday, Tor Ekeland, lawyer for Clearview AI, said the tool “only accesses publicly available data from the public internet,” saying the app is “is strictly an after-the-fact investigative tool for law enforcement, and is used to solve crimes including murder, rape and child exploitation.” Alongside Peel and Halton, Toronto and Durham police have confirmed they recently tested Clearview AI. A spokesperson for Durham Region said the chief was not available for an interview, while Toronto police chief Mark Saunders will speak to the media once that service’s ongoing review has been completed, a Toronto police spokesperson said. On Friday, Hamilton police confirmed to the Star that officers from its force’s tech crime unit were given login credentials for Clearview AI as part of a trial period, but haven’t used the tool for any investigative purposes. A spokesperson said the force has no plans to adopt the use of Clearview AI. The RCMP and Ontario Provincial Police will not say if they have used the facial recognition tool. It’s not clear if any arrests have been made as a result of the technology; both Tanner and Duraiappah said the tool wasn’t used on active cases. Duraiappah says he’s unperturbed about “parking” Clearview AI — it wasn’t “a dominant software that we were committed to.” But he wants there to be a greater conversation about other ways police can make use of facial recognition. Recently, he said, a civilian officer watched 1,000 hours of surveillance video to identify a face in an effort to solve a homicide — something he said could much more easily be done leveraging AI tech. Both Duraiappah and Tanner said police should be able to search, via facial recognition, their internal databases of photos taken of suspects under the Identification of Criminals Act, which allows police, under certain circumstances, to fingerprint and photograph people charged with a crime. Toronto police revealed last year that they were using facial recognition technology to compare images of potential suspects captured on public or private cameras to its internal database of approximately 1.5 million mugshots. “I’m really interested in innovative ways to leverage technology to help us towards a public safety goal, without really jumping the queue on privacy issues,” said Duraiappah.

They seem to be the only public authorities prepared to push back against the attempt to end the right to simply go about one’s business in public without being subject to official surveillance. Certainly, we can’t trust the police on this front. Thanks to the Star’s Kate Allen and Wendy Gillis, we’ve learned that at least four Toronto-area forces have dipped their toes into this poisoned pool. They’ve tested controversial facial recognition technology that, on the face of it, violates Canadian law and the right of ordinary people to basic privacy. The police forces — in Toronto, Peel Region, Halton and Durham — all say they’ve stopped using the technology developed by the American company Clearview AI. As they should. Nor, it seems, can we rely on our politicians. Neither the federal government nor the provinces have kept up with the new threats posed by technology to your privacy. They have lagged behind while the tech companies come up with increasingly sophisticated ways to make money off personal information. Instead, it’s been left up the privacy commissioners to take the lead in this case, and they deserve three cheers for stepping up. Four commissioners — those in Ottawa, British Columbia, Alberta and Quebec — announced on Friday that they will conduct a joint investigation into Clearview AI, dubbed by the New York Times as “the secretive company that might end privacy as we know it.” It was the Times that shone a bright light on Clearview in January, reporting that the little-known start-up had developed a revolutionary facial recognition app designed to let police forces and others identify people by matching their photos with billions of images scraped from Facebook, Youtube, and millions of other sites on the internet. Some 600 police forces are already using the app, according to the company, although some cities, including San Francisco, have banned it. The potential for misuse is obvious. Anyone with access to such a tool could instantly find out all sorts of personal information about a person simply from an image captured in public. Not even a name would be needed to figure out a person’s movements, friends, employment history, associations, and so on. Even Google, according to the Times, decided years ago that this was one area it wouldn’t venture into because the technology could be used “in a very bad way.” Appropriating that kind of personal information is also almost certainly illegal in Canada. Michael Bryant, executive director of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, explained in the Star this past week that there must be “due process and and appropriate safeguards in place” before any kind of biometric information, such as DNA or fingerprints, are collected or stored. There must be “compliance with laws designed to recognize that biometrics are particularly personal, sensitive information.” And what could be more personal than your own face? It seems hard to imagine that the privacy commissioners will not conclude that the kind of “facial fingerprinting” system developed by Clearview AI runs afoul of federal and provincial privacy laws, especially in the absence of any guarantees against misuse. What’s needed is a comprehensive framework for the use of any such technology, and a pause in its use while those rules are developed.

Police tweeted that after providing demonstrators with an injunction and encouraging peaceful departure, they began moving people from the tracks near Lambton Arena off Jane and Dundas West streets. Police said most protesters were co-operative but arrests were made when necessary. Toronto police tweeted on Wednesday evening that 37 people were arrested during the blockades. Of those arrested, 25 were released unconditionally. The remaining 12 were criminally charged with mischief. Seven of the 12 are also facing charges under the Rail Safety Act, police said. Metrolinx said the police investigation along the tracks between Aldershot GO and Hamilton GO has cleared and they anticipate that it will be operating regular train service from Niagara Falls, St. Catharines, Hamilton and West Harbour GO stations this morning. The transit agency also anticipates running regular services on the Milton line but noted that it will depend on “circumstances that are out of their control” and that in the event that an alternate route is taken, passengers should plan ahead to avoid delays. Anne Marie Aikins, spokesperson for Metrolinx said they’re currently waiting for an “OK” from CP, as the Milton line runs through it. “We are determined to operate Milton service. We just might have to operate a bypass which takes longer,” said Aikins. “Every other line is going to operate for now — that is our plan — but it is a very fluid situation unfortunately.” The number of people gathered at Lambton Arena dwindled throughout the evening and into early Wednesday. Toronto police cleared the rail path at about 3 a.m., carrying some 30 people off the tracks one by one. Another 30 protesters on the opposite side of a fence blocking off the tracks chanted “shame” and “solidarity” as police formed a human chain paving the way between the protesters on the track and a couple of court services vehicles waiting nearby. Several people carried off the path were allowed to walk free, though some were taken into custody. It’s unclear how many people were arrested over the course of the 11-hour protest and how many face charges. “This is colonization as usual,” one protester, named Lil Bear, told the Star. “Same thing we’ve been enduring for hundreds of years. It’s despicable.” He said the arrests wouldn’t deter protesters from creating more blockades moving forwards. “This is for our future. For the future of our planet.” “We knew these arrests were coming from the very beginning,” said Koryn John, who was carried out of the rail path by three officers. “This is what inevitably happens when we protest, but that isn’t going stop us.

As many as eight arrests were made at the Dundas and Jane Street rail lands after a blockade took over the tracks, a major rail artery through Canada’s largest city. Supporters shouted “shame” as police made the arrests. “LAND BACK!” read one sign protesters stretched between two rail lines. “I’m going to stay here until they remove me or until we’re free,” said a defiant Olivia Coombe, who sat, wrapped in a blanket, a few metres from the tracks, with dozens of other protesters amid a heavy police presence.

While those talks continue, protesters across the country have taken to the rail lines. The hereditary chiefs claim control over lands the pipeline would have to cross. Tuesday, Toronto and GTA rail lines were hit with temporary blockades during the afternoon and evening commute with protests stopping GO Train service and regular rail traffic. Union Station in Toronto was jammed with frustrated commuters. Metrolinx warned of disruptions “throughout our entire system.” Regular service resumed in the early evening but not before thousands of passengers were delayed. If the protests continue until Wednesday, rail officials and protesters will also have to contend with an approaching snowstorm created by a low pressure zone in Texas that threatens to further disrupt the afternoon and evening commute. Delays on GO Transit began Monday afternoon when a Wet’suwet’en solidarity blockade went up in Hamilton. The disruption along what the commuter service describes as its busiest route left thousands of passengers scrambling to make alternative travel arrangements. Hamilton police said protesters left the blockade site peacefully at around 5 p.m. Tuesday. As that blockade was being dismantled two other blockades were springing up in locations in Toronto. Metrolinx spokesperson Anne Marie Aikins said there had been reports of disruptions at Kipling station on the Milton line, as well as at Guildwood on Lakeshore East. GO warned of severe crowding at Union Station as a result. Frustrating matters was that attendants who were trying to help passengers didn’t have the latest accurate information. Commuters who spoke to the Star didn’t share frustrations with the protesters. Instead they focused their anger on Metrolinx employees who couldn’t help them. Metrolinx tweeted at around 4:45 p.m. that the situation at Guildwood had been cleared and normal service was resuming. At about 6:30 p.m., the first train to Milton finally departed Union after a two-hour delay but it was using a diversion. Aikins called Tuesday’s disruption “unprecedented.” Metrolinx said they expect GO transit will be back to normal for Wednesday’s commute, though they anticipated some delays on the Milton line. Aikins said the agency had been preparing for potential disruptions in the wake of protests across the country in solidarity with Wet’suwet’en chiefs.

The OPP enforced a court injunction against a protest camp that had blocked one of Canada’s key rail lines since Feb. 6. Canadian National and Via Rail had temporarily laid off 1,500 workers as a result. What watchers say may become a rotating series of protests across the country — “don’t expect anything to stop,” said one activist — is a show of solidarity for hereditary Wet’suwet’en chiefs who are opposing construction of a pipeline over B.C. land they say they hold dominion over. According to the project website, the $6.2 billion Coastal GasLink pipeline is designed to “safely deliver natural gas across northern B.C.” A total of 670 kilometres in length, it aims to deliver natural gas from the Dawson Creek area to a facility near Kitimat, where it will be prepared for “export to global markets by converting the gas to a liquefied state.” While Coastal GasLink announced in 2018 the signing of agreements with 20 First Nation Band councils along the route — including Wet’suwet’en Nation — the project is being opposed by the hereditary Wet’suwet’en chiefs, who say the land in question was never part of a treaty. The hereditary chiefs have said it cannot proceed without their consent. Wet’suwet’en officials issued an “eviction notice” to Coastal GasLink on Jan. 4, and the RCMP moved into the area shortly after, sparking protests across the country and debates in Ottawa. There has been an ebb and flow to the nature of the protests. Tuesday afternoon, rumours spread in the city that a protest would be set up — somewhere — in the city at 4 p.m. Right on the dot of 4 p.m., on rail tracks near Jane and Dundas Streets, activists, hand in hand, formed a circular blockade to stop train traffic. Toronto Police warned those present they would be charged and face fines of $5,000 or more if they did not leave. Protesters played soft music and lit a fire to keep warm. As the evening wore on, eight arrests were made (police would not confirm the number) and the protesters moved off the rail lines and kept an uneasy vigil, facing police. Crystal Sinclair of the Idle No More protest movement told the Star she had come to the Jane and Dundas rail lands to support other Indigenous people across the country who are voicing their concerns about land ownership. “This is about making a statement. Indigenous sovereignty is not being respected,” she said as the crowd of protesters grew larger in the evening. “They have to start paying attention, get off our land because injustice to one is injustice to all.” At about 10 p.m., between 20 and 30 protesters remained on the tracks surrounded by police. A short distance away, roughly a hundred protesters huddled around the fence that closes off the rail line, chanting, holding signs and raising their fists. There were some tense moments amid a heavy police presence, but also periods of calm, with protesters sharing boxes of pizza that had been delivered to the scene. Tuesday, the day after the arrests in Marysville of 10 activists, dawned with a strong police presence in the area, as a means to keep protesters away from the CN rail tracks they had occupied for more than two weeks. David Milne, of Belleville, who visited the Wyman Road encampment in Marysville Tuesday, in support of the protesters, described himself as a settler who empathizes with the plight of First Nations people.

Ottawa hopes soFeb. 25, 2020 “I want a resolution that they (First Nations) feel is just and that they can live with long-term,” Milne said, standing near the entrance to the encampment. “We’re also opposed to the use of violence to remove these people from demonstrating.” He said legions of officers moving in to quash a demonstration on Indigenous land is just a microcosm of the larger neglect of First Nation rights. “I have trouble with that,” said Milne, of the arrests the day before. “That’s just a symptom of what’s wrong.” Milne, who was allowed to enter the encampment to meet with the small group of protesters still at the site, said he was acting on the behalf of global faith-based group Christian Peacemaker Teams. “We’re here as human rights observers,” he said. “We got their permission.” While Milne struggled to propose any solutions, his colleague, Robert Holmes said the RCMP must pull out of Wet’suwet’en territory before any meaningful dialogue can happen. “We have to recognize the sovereignty of the Wet’suwet’en,” Holmes said. “The immediate solution is: RCMP out, the pipeline people out, and we sit down and negotiate.” At the break of dawn, Tuesday, no one was manning the makeshift gate, guarded Monday by a man who prevented media from entering the Mohawk encampment. A pile of wood sat near the gate made of wooden skids, while several Mohawk flags mounted on the gate blew in the wind. A few cars sit idling, while two men sat next to a fire. Two women sorted food items — cupcakes, doughnuts, muffin and Tim Hortons coffee containers — sitting on two tables inside the Mohawk encampment.

Peter Boncardo, father to a young son and an officer of 15 years who identified himself as an expert in guns and gangs. “I’m currently off right now. I went off in October on stress leave.” In a three-minute speech to the board, Boncardo said that with rising gang violence, officers who deal with “guns, drugs, violence and death” are “not immune” to the impacts of the job. And yet, he’s experienced insufficient mental health support compounded by a “gap” in communication between officers and higher-ups about how to fix increasing violence. “There’s a gap there between guns-and-gang violence: what we know about it, and what we do about it. And because of that, you have people that are going off sick, that are trying to express what that issue is, and it’s not being heard,” he said. Feeling some relief that “today it’s been heard,” he nonetheless shared his concerns about the cost of speaking out. “And what do we say? Sometimes career suicide’s better than the other one,” Boncardo said, ending his deputation. The speech came at a Toronto police board meeting that began with a moment of silence for Toronto police Const. Mike Austin. The 21-year veteran of the service died by suicide inside Toronto police headquarters earlier this month. “He leaves an important legacy of great professionalism, sincere dedication and invaluable mentorship and is dearly missed both by his family and by the members of this organization,” said Toronto police board chair Jim Hart. Boncardo suggested that, as gang violence has increased there has been a lack of communication between frontline experts like himself and the decision-makers, a disconnect causing stress among officers, he said. “Ever heard of me?” he asked the seven-member board, Saunders and upper command officers. “I’m an expert on this, and we have numerous ones on that unit. We travel all around the province talking on guns-and-gang issues. We’ve got them in the city. There’s probably nobody here at this table or at this office that’s ever heard of me.” Boncardo also noted that mental health supports have, in his experience, been insufficient. “I won’t go so far as ‘it’s failed me,’ but there’s certainly a long stretch that it needs to go,” he said. One of the biggest things that he needs, Boncardo said, is someone to listen. “I’d love nothing more than to talk,” he said. “I’ve asked for help and listening for quite a while. I need that to be done.” He offered himself an asset to the board and the service to help determine how to fix the problems. As a police officer off on stress leave, “I think I’d be a valuable asset to discuss this with.” Responding to his own officer’s deputation, Saunders told Boncardo he does know who he is. “First off Peter, I have heard of you and I want to say, thank you for the work that you have done,” Saunders said, assuring him what he was doing was not career suicide.

The discovery of 60 handguns buried in bedding in the trunk of Harris Poyser’s rented vehicle on May 23, 2018, outside a home in Cornwall, on the U.S. border in eastern Ontario, was billed as the largest single seizure of illegal firearms in the history of the Toronto Police Service. Wearing a white-collared, blue button-down shirt and black jeans, Poyser’s voice was barely audible in the empty courtroom as he answered “yes” to Justice John McMahon’s questions meant to ensure an accused person’s plea has not been coerced. McMahon said he was satisfied Poyser had made the decision to enter a guilty plea in consultation with his lawyer Michael Quigley rather than stand trial next month. Poyser pleaded guilty to six charges, including instructing the commission of an offence for the benefit of a criminal organization, importing firearms and possession of firearms for the purpose of trafficking. The judge told Poyser he faces a prison sentence of between 10 and 15 years. A sentencing hearing is set for May 7, two weeks before Poyser’s 60th birthday. He remains in custody. On Wednesday, the prosecution read a synopsis of the crimes committed by Poyser and his alleged accomplices. During the spring of 2018, Poyser was working in association with Ernest Wilson, a man known as “Biggs” who was living in Florida. Poyser, Wilson, Kareem Lewis — a co-accused who has since died — and a man known as “Apache” worked together to bring illegal firearms north and other contraband south across the Canada-United States border for illegal sale in both countries, court heard. Wilson — who is also now dead — would buy handguns from various dealers in Florida and have them shipped north to the border near Cornwall. Apache would arrange for the handguns and other contraband Wilson was sending north to cross the border and be delivered to a house at 515 Oliver Lane in Cornwall. Poyser, or someone instructed and supervised by Poyser, would pick up the handguns and other contraband for transport to Toronto, where it would be sold on the black market, Crown attorney Sam Scratch said, reading from an agreed statement of facts. Poyser would also arrange for Canadian contraband to be exported illegally to the U.S. using Apache and Wilson’s network, Scratch said. (He did not elaborate on the other contraband, nor which border crossing was used.) Poyser’s collaboration with his associates made up a criminal organization, which made his crimes more serious and subject to a stiffer penalty. The Crown’s synopsis included summaries of several transactions in the illegal import-export scheme, which was active in April and May 2018. The smugglers were caught on wiretaps using the code name “Irish” for handguns. On May 7, Poyser instructed two associates to travel to Cornwall to pick up handguns that Wilson had sent north and Apache had shepherded across the border. Poyser was intercepted discussing with Wilson how to divide the handguns and, on this occasion, Poyser’s two associates — one of them Lewis — picked up a shipment of 29 handguns and delivered them to Poyser’s house in Scarborough. There, they divided the guns for each to sell in Toronto. On average, Wilson was receiving $2,500 per gun. Poyser’s two associates were seeking prices in the range of $4,000. In all, the trio made a profit of $1,500 per illegal gun sold, Scratch told court. On the day of his May 23, 2018, arrest, Poyser and Lewis drove separately from Toronto to the Oliver Lane house in Cornwall. There, an unidentified man loaded two large bags containing bedding and 60 handguns into the trunk of Poyser’s rented car. This entire exchange was captured on video by a police surveillance plane equipped with a long-range camera that followed Poyser. Wilson had indicated there was also to be another shipment of 40 guns.

But before he reached the ramp, officers boxed his vehicle in and arrested him. They found 60 handguns and 108 magazines, 54 of them high-capacity and, therefore, themselves prohibited devices. Poyser was not licensed to possess a firearm at the time and had never registered a firearm. Lewis was also picked up by police after Poyser’s arrest. He died awaiting trial. Toronto police have long warned of the flow of illegal firearms over the Canada-U.S. border. Last month, police released statistics saying 82 per cent of the traceable handguns they seized in 2019 originated in the U.S., with the remainder coming from Canada. However, of the 453 handguns Toronto police seized, nearly a quarter — 107 — were not traced, according to the data. Betsy Powell is a Toronto-based reporter covering crime and courts.

That is how the 24-year-old woman is described in a GoFundMe campaign set up to help her family and young daughter after she was killed at a North York spa Monday. “With the utmost sadness we are forced to say goodbye to Ashley,” the campaign description reads. “Words cannot express the shock and grief that has come to everyone blessed enough to have crossed paths with Ashley.” Arzaga was killed in a stabbing at Crown Spa at 3598 Dufferin St., just south of Wilson Avenue. It occurred around 12:45 p.m. Once Toronto police officers arrived on scene, they located two people outside the massage parlour: a male lying on the street and a female, both suffering from multiple stab wounds. Inside the building, police located a woman who was pronounced dead at the scene. Police said a weapon was found. “Ashley is so loved and was such an outgoing, positive, kind, loving and genuinely good young woman,” the GoFundMe campaign reads.

Kalen Schlatter, 23, is facing a charge of first-degree murder in the case. He has pleaded not guilty. The 22-year-old aspiring flight attendant was found dead in a stairwell near where she was last seen alive on Church St. on Nov. 25, 2017. The jury is expected to hear evidence from the people who last saw Richey alive and undercover officers who spoke to Schlatter after his arrest while posing as his cellmates. The Crown alleges Schlatter told the officers he was upset because Richey refused to have sex with him. The Toronto police were sharply criticized for failing to investigate Richey’s disappearance properly. This took place amid concerns that missing-persons cases linked to the Gay Village were not being taken seriously. Her case was among those which prompted the police board to commission a sweeping review of how Toronto police handle missing-persons investigations. The Star will update this story as the trial progresses. It is set to last six to eight weeks. Jan 30: The trial began with the Crown’s opening address to the jury. Prosecutor Beverley Richards gave a detailed account of the evidence the jury is expected to hear, which includes surveillance video the Crown said will show Schlatter and Richey walking towards the stairwell where her body was found, and Schlatter walking away alone 45 minutes later. Richey’s body was found four days later. The Crown said Schlatter’s semen was found on the outside of Richey’s pants. The trial also heard from police witnesses who took the jury through photos of the various locations around Church Street, including the stairwell. Jan 31: Rachel Richey, Tess Richey’s older sister, gave emotional testimony about the last time she saw her sister alive — Nov. 24, 2017 — and the frantic search that began the next day. Their mother, Christine Hermeston, drove down from North Bay to help in the search. Four days later, Hermeston and her friend were searching the area around Church Street where Richey was last seen alive. Hermeston’s friend Ann Brazeau testified, through tears: “I just saw her lying there and I went into complete shock. Horror. Disbelief. I couldn’t process or make sense of what I was seeing …. I was terrified.” The trial also heard from Kabous Abadi, a hot dog vendor who said two women and a man came by his stand on Church Street in the early hours of Nov. 25, 2017. The man paid. He recognized the women when police came by with photos. Feb 3: Uber driver Marlon Allamby testified that he responded to a request for an UberPool from Tess Richey’s account at 4:02 a.m. on Nov. 25, 2017, on Church Street. She never showed up. The jury also heard more testimony about the discovery of Tess Richey’s body in the external stairwell of a house under renovation at 582 Church St. around 3 p.m. on Nov. 28, 2017. Const. Robert Chevalier, a neighbourhood police officer based in the Church-Wellesley neighbourhood, said he joined the investigation after seeing a flyer about Richey at the 519 Community Centre that morning. He said missing people in the area were a concern, and noted that at the time serial killer Bruce McArthur had not yet been caught. Chevalier said he met Richey’s mother and friend in the afternoon. They asked him to check out the address of a nearby house. Shortly after he got there, he heard a scream. He went into the alleyway and saw the stairwell, obscured from the main street by a gravel pile. He saw a dead body in the stairwell, with a pink handbag next to her. Court ended at around 2:30 p.m. because a juror injured herself in a fall over the lunch break. The rest of Chevalier’s testimony was postponed to the next day. Feb 4: In one of the most difficult moments of the trial so far, the jury was shown photographs of Richey’s body as it was found at the bottom of a stairwell leading down to the basement door of a house under renovation on Church Street. Richey’s family left the courtroom while the photographs were shown in court. The trial also heard from Ryley Simard who had gone out drinking and dancing with Richey at the Crews and Tangos bar on Church Street the night she was killed. Simard, who was one of the last people to see her friend alive, testified that she and Richey were asked to leave the bar at around 2 a.m., both very drunk. They walked along Church Street, stopped at a hot dog stand, and then stopped outside at a house on Dundonald Street where Richey had a conversation with a woman. While the hot dog vendor testified Schlatter was with the two women at the hot dog stand, Simard did not mention it in her testimony. She did testify that she kissed Schlatter goodbye on the lips before she went home around 4 a.m., leaving Richey and Schlatter in the Church Street area. Feb. 5: On the night Kalen Schlatter was arrested, Feb. 4, 2018, he was put in the police station holding cells with two undercover officers posing as two men arrested for possessing stolen property. One of the undercover officers began his testimony Wednesday from behind a screen meant to conceal his identity from the public. He is known as Undercover Officer 1. Schlatter told the officers he’d been arrested for Richey’s murder and claimed they’d met at the Crews and Tangos bar where they kissed and danced, the officer testified. He said that after her friend went home, he led Richey into the alley and then stairwell to “hook up” but was “pissed off” when she refused to have sex with him. He claimed she wanted to stay in the stairwell and he asked her if he should stay. She said no and he left her there alive, the officer said Schlatter told him. “Mr. Schlatter said he was drunk and something could have happened, but he doesn’t remember and he doesn’t think he’s capable of doing it,” the officer recalled. Court ended at 1 p.m., with the officer’s examination-in-chief set to continue the next day. Feb. 6: The testimony of the undercover officer concluded just after 11 a.m. The jury was then dismissed for the day for reasons of ensuring a fair trial “through no fault of counsel for the defence or counsel for the Crown.” Superior Court Justice Michael Dambrot apologized to the jury for the inconvenience. The cross-examination of the officer by the defence is expected to start Friday morning. Feb 7: One of Schlatter’s defence lawyers, Lydia Riva, argued the undercover officer’s memory and notes of the conversation with Schlatter in the cells was unreliable, cannot be trusted and that he omitted key context. The conversation was videotaped, but not audio-recorded. Riva suggested there were important discrepancies between the memories of the two undercover officers. The second officer has not yet testified. She also suggested that Schlatter bragged about his sexual exploits with women, because he is bisexual and was afraid of how he might be treated in jail if that were known. Feb 10: For the morning, the jury watched hours of soundless video clips of Schlatter in a small holding cell, with an undercover officer in a cell on either side. He can be seen speaking, though it is impossible to know what he is saying. The jury has heard that the police did not get a judicial authorization for an audio recording of the conversation between Schlatter and two undercover officers. But the jury has not heard why. Feb 11: One of the undercover officers’ handlers, who supervised the undercover operation, testified that there was an “officer protection kit” in the cell with the first undercover officer. The device allowed the handlers to listen to the conversation solely for officer safety, which in this case meant possible medical issues or distress, he said. He said he did not listen to the content of the conversation, only for any indication or signal of a problem from the officers. He said he did not take notes of the conversation as that would not be allowed. The jury also heard from the second undercover officer, who gave a much less detailed account of the conversation than the first. He corroborated some of the account given by the other officer but defence lawyer Lydia Riva pointed out some differences and omissions. The second officer could not recall if Schlatter said he was “pissed off” or upset that he could not have sex with Tess Richey. Riva also seized on the differences in words. The second officer said Schlatter said he was “acting” emotional when shown photos of Richey’s body by the police, while the first said he said he “pretended” to be emotional. Feb 12: The jury began viewing surveillance videos seized from the Crews and Tangos bar showing the movements of both Schlatter and Richey from the night of Nov 24, 2017. The jury also saw the security video that the Crown says shows Richey and Schlatter walking towards the stairwell where Richey’s body was later found, and Schlatter walking out alone 45 minutes later. Feb 13, 14 and 17: The trial did not sit. Feb. 17 was Family Day and court was closed. Feb 18: The jury continued watching security videos from Crews and Tangos. They watched Richey and Simard dancing under strobe lights in the crowded bar. The two women occasionally crossed paths with Schlatter, who was also at the bar, but they don’t appear to notice each other at all. Feb: 19: In the morning, the pathologist who conducted the autopsy of Richey’s body testified. Dr. Kona Williams concluded Richey had been strangled to death, possibly with a soft cloth ligature, a forearm pressed against her neck or in a chokehold. The time of Richey’s death is consistent with when she is last seen alive on the security videos with Schlatter, around 4 a.m. on Nov. 25, 2017 but Williams could not pinpoint an exact time and said it could have been later. In the afternoon, the jury resumed watching security footage. They saw Richey and Simard leave Crews and Tangos at around 2:18 a.m. and linger on the sidewalk for some minutes before they started walking north on Church St. Schlatter is also standing on the sidewalk outside the bar. Simard goes up to Schlatter and they speak briefly – the Crown has said this was Schlatter offering a light for her cigarette but Simard did not recall the interaction when she testified. Schlatter could also be seen slowly moving north on Church St., the same direction as Richey and Simard. Feb 20: The jury saw the last security footage of Richey alive. At about 4:15 a.m. on Nov. 25, 2017, Schlatter and Richey walked hand-in-hand into the alley off Church Street where her body was found days later at the bottom of a stairwell leading to the basement of a house under renovation. Schlatter leaves the alley alone about 45 minutes later. The detective who reviewed the footage from cameras all around the area, including motion-activated cameras with a view of the fence at the back of the house, said he didn’t see Richey leave or anyone else go in or out of the area for the next two hours. Feb 21: During cross-examination the defence drew the jury’s attention to another man seen in a pink hat in the videos. The defence has suggested they will argue it is possible another person was responsible for killing Richey after getting to the alley and stairwell by climbing over a fence at the back. Feb. 24: Cross-examination on the video evidence ended and the jury heard testimony from a police officer who executed a search warrant on Schlatter’s home. Photos of Schlatter’s bedroom, which showed board games and video games, were used by undercover officers to find common ground with Schlatter while they posed as recently arrested men in holding cells next to Schlatter. The jury has heard Schlatter opened up after one of the undercover officers mentioned the card game Magic: The Gathering. Feb 25: The Crown introduced several text message conversations taken from Schlatter’s phone after it was seized by police upon his arrest on Feb. 4, 2018. The messages included flirtatious and sexual conversations with women in the days and months after Richey was last seen alive. The jury has heard two undercover officers testify that Schlatter boasted extensively about his sexual exploits with women. The defence has suggested he was bragging out of fear of what would happen to him in jail if it were known he is bisexual. In one text, from 9:46 p.m. on Nov 26, 2017 — almost two days after Schlatter and Richey were captured on video walking into the alley — he told one woman: “This weekend has been the worst for me and I’ve been so stressed out.” Get more of what matters in your inboxStart your morning with everything you need to know, and nothing you don't.

Feb 27: Undercover Officer 1 was recalled and further questioned by the defence. Using the faint audio from the booking room video, the defence suggested the officer was the one who prompted conversation with Schlatter. The officer said it was Schlatter who prompted the conversation and said he could not make out what was being said between him and Schlatter in the background audio. The jury also heard evidence from a toxicologist about the amount of alcohol Tess Richey had in her system at the time of her death — at most 206 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood. A forensic biologist testified about the DNA evidence obtained from Richey’s clothes. Semen on her pants and saliva on her bra were found to match Schlatter’s DNA. Feb 28: The testimony of the forensic biologist concluded and court broke around 11 a.m. Mar. 2: The trial did not sit. Mar. 3: In testimony that at times appeared straight out of “The Wire,” a combative life-long criminal and self-professed liar who once shared a jail cell with Schlatter testified that Schlatter confessed to strangling Tess Richey with a scarf and ejaculating on her body after she refused to have sex with him. Schlatter said he was “too worked up” to stop, the jailhouse informant who can only be described as E.S., told the jury. While E.S. said he was only testifying for “the dead girl and her family” and that he was not receiving any consideration from the Crown for his own pending charges, the defence suggested he had manufactured the confession in order to help himself in the future. Mar. 4: E.S., who became increasingly hostile and insulting towards Schlatter’s defence lawyer during cross-examination, concluded his testimony. The jury then heard evidence about Schlatter’s cellphone records. Mar. 5: The jury heard from a correctional officer at the Toronto South Detention Centre, who testified about the period of time E.S. and Schlatter were in custody together. The jury also heard from Det. Ted Lioumanis, the officer-in-charge of the case. He said that on Dec. 10, 2017, the police released images of a man from an ATM security video. Kalen Schlatter called in to the police station and said he was the person in the photos. However, when at the station he did not admit to being the person in the photos. Police obtained his DNA off a water bottle Schlatter had drunk from and discarded.

Sgt. Graham Gibson who testified about how police came to arrest Schlatter. Police had been working on getting a judicial authorization to record the undercover operation in the cells, however it was not completed when Schlatter was arrested. Gibson said the decision to arrest Schlatter was a matter of public safety. “It was a stranger-on-stranger homicide,” he said. “I couldn’t guarantee eyes on him all the time.” He also said he did not want to arrest Schlatter at his home because of the potential for a volatile and dangerous situation. Schlatter was arrested on Feb. 4, 2018 after watching the Superbowl at a movie theatre with his family. The Crown closed their case at the end of Gibson’s testimony. Mar. 9: Kalen Schlatter testified in his defence. Mar. 10: Schlatter was cross-examined. Mar. 11: Trial did not sit. Mar. 12: The defence called to the stand a man they claim was responsible for Richey’s murder. Mar. 13: The man was cross-examined by the Crown. The defence closed its case.

Supt. Steve Watts of the organized crime enforcement unit told reporters Thursday that officers quickly arrested a 38-year-old man suspected of selling the extremely dangerous drugs, believed to be fentanyl mixed with one or more substances. “While we have arrested an alleged dealer, there is also the possibility that further batches of this substance remain on our streets at this time,” Watts said, adding that “purchasing, ingesting street drugs truly is a form of Russian roulette” with potentially deadly consequences. Public health staff at the city-run The Works supervised-injection site near Yonge-Dundas Square raised the alarm Wednesday night after “a rapid increase in overdoses.” Paramedics used a bus to transport patients to three different health facilities for treatment. Police at 51 Division called in the drug squad. “Despite being administered (the opioid antidote) naloxone, none of these individuals recovered in a way that was typical for a normal fentanyl overdose,” Watts said. “This leads us to believe that the substance was fentanyl and another unidentified substance.” Public health sent samples of the drug to St. Michael’s Hospital for testing. Police have sent samples to Health Canada. Within two hours of being notified, police had arrested Whanny Mymuller of Toronto and charged him with possession of drugs for the purpose of trafficking and possession of proceeds of crime. He was to appear in court at Old City Hall on Thursday. Watts noted that Halton Regional Police on Wednesday warned residents there of a drug mixture of flualprazolam, fentanyl, caffeine and dimethylsuplhone. Flualprazolam is a synthetically manufactured central nervous system depressant, similar to Xanax but far more potent. Flualprazolam is not an opioid. As a result, naloxone may not reverse overdose effects. Halton police said they aren’t aware of any overdoses resulting from the mixture but issued the alert knowing that flualprazolam has been linked to deaths in North America. Watts said the drugs seized by Toronto police may be the same or a similar concoction. The suspected dealer was arrested very close to The Works, he said, adding that officers routinely arrest dealers selling to people outside supervised-injection sites. “The moment you establish a (no-arrest) ‘safe zone’ around a supervised injection site you give free rein to predator traffickers to prey” on people with substance-abuse issues, Watts said. Dr. Eileen de Villa, Toronto’s medical officer of health, said in a statement public health had to call in extra staff and extended hours until 11 p.m. Her department will notify the public as soon as it gets results of tests on the tainted drugs, she said.

Between those two moments on Nov. 25, 2017, captured in less than 20 seconds of black-and-white security video and shown to a Toronto jury, the Crown alleges Schlatter sexually assaulted and strangled 22-year-old Richey after she refused to have sex with him. The defence at Schlatter’s ongoing first-degree murder trial has suggested someone else could be responsible for killing Richey sometime after Schlatter walked away. Richey was never seen alive again and an officer has testified the motion-activated security videos in the area do not show anyone else entering or leaving the alley area. Richey’s body was found four days later by her mother and friend at the bottom of a stairwell leading to a basement door near the back of the alley. Schlatter, 23, has pleaded not guilty. On Thursday, forensic biologist Melissa Kell testified that Schlatter’s DNA was found in saliva on Richey’s bra and semen on her upper left pant leg. Earlier on Thursday, one of two undercover officers who were placed in holding cells at a police station with Schlatter after his arrest was recalled to answer further questions from the defence. The officer had previously testified about his part in an undercover operation to get Schlatter to discuss Richey’s death. Defence lawyer Lydia Riva played a portion of a video of Schlatter being taken through a police office and being put into the cells. In the video you can hear the cell door bang shut and then, she said, it is possible to faintly hear the start of the undercover officer’s conversation with Schlatter through the open office door. The officer has testified that it was Schlatter who prompted all the topics of conversation, including an initial discussion about the Superbowl. Schlatter had been arrested after watching the game with his family at a theatre. The conversation between Schlatter and the two officers was not audio-recorded. The content of the conversation has come from the testimony of the two officers, with the defence challenging the reliability and accuracy of their memories of the conversation which took place over about four hours. The officer said he was unable to hear this on the poor-quality audio, and said it also wouldn’t be possible to know if that was the start of a conversation. He said he did hear someone who could have been him say: “I didn’t finish the f---ing game.” The officer denied that he was pretending he couldn’t hear what was being said in the audio in order to avoid contradicting his testimony that it was Schlatter who began the Superbowl conversation.

Riva suggested the officer wanted Schlatter’s words to be heard clearly by other officers via the transmitting device, rather than using the device to monitor for any signs of officer distress. The officer denied this. The jury also briefly heard from Betty Chow, a Centre of Forensic Sciences toxicologist who tested a sample of Richey’s blood for alcohol. She found a blood alcohol level of 206 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood, high enough to possibly cause significant cognitive impairment and physical symptoms like slurring and inability to walk properly, she said. The blood alcohol level could have been elevated by 20mg to 30mg due to the decomposition of Richey’s body prior to the sample being taken, she said.

The incident occurred in the area of Richmond and Sherbourne Street in downtown Toronto around 8:50 p.m. The helicopter was on its way to Billy Bishop Airport after completing a call to The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, when the pilot was struck with the laser. As a result of the strike, the pilot and another paramedic on board each sustained an eye injury, and had to go to a local Toronto hospital for evaluation. A video of the strike was captured by the flight crew and provided to Toronto Police. Ornge Corporate Communications Officer Rachel Scott said that the pilot and the paramedic are now doing okay. Following the incident, a report was filed with Toronto police and Transport Canada for investigation. Pointing lasers at an aircraft is a criminal offence. Under the Aeronautics Act, an individual convicted of pointing a laser at an aircraft faces up to $100,000 in fines, or five years in prison, or both. Anyone who witnessed the incident is asked to contact Toronto Police and Transport Canada. Although Toronto police says these incidents are not that common, news reports suggest otherwise. This year, there have been five reported laser strikes on Ornge helicopters alone, up from three last year. Toronto Star has reported on several incidents of laser attacks on Toronto-bound flights.

On Thursday, a dozen police forces and private businesses confirmed their officers or employees had used the technology, including nine forces from across the country that had previously told the Star they did not use Clearview AI. The U.S. company uses artificial intelligence to match people’s images against a database of billions of photos scraped from the internet, including social media sites, and has been called “reckless,” “invasive,” and “dystopian” by critics. Privacy regulators opened an investigation into the legality of the company’s practices last week, and on Thursday evening the federal privacy commissioner announced it was launching an investigation into the RCMP’s use of the technology. Among the newest known users are the Via Rail Police Service, cops in Halifax, Cornwall and London, and investigators with the Insurance Bureau of Canada. All but the Mounties used free trial versions of the tool. Many police forces said that members had signed up without the knowledge or authorization of leadership, who were unaware officers were using Clearview AI until the Star’s inquiries prompted further digging. The revelations were prompted by data obtained by BuzzFeed News. According to the data, which was shared exclusively with the Toronto Star, at least 34 police forces across Canada have obtained log-ins and searched Clearview AI’s database in recent months. The widespread, often apparently unsanctioned use of Clearview AI shows how far the adoption of powerful artificial intelligence technology like facial recognition has outpaced regulation and oversight. It also shows how rapidly the controversial technology has spread globally. BuzzFeed reported Thursday that 2,900 institutions in 27 different countries have collectively made about 500,000 searches through the company’s service. According to the data, Canada is Clearview’s largest market outside of the U.S. Clearview AI did not respond to repeated requests from the Star for comment on Thursday. A lawyer for the New York-based startup told other media a “flaw” gave someone unauthorized access to the company’s client list. “Security is Clearview’s top priority,” Tor Ekeland told other media. “Unfortunately, data breaches are part of life in the 21st century. Our servers were never accessed. We patched the flaw and continue to work to strengthen our security.” In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Ekeland said: “There are numerous inaccuracies in this illegally obtained information. As there is an ongoing Federal investigation, we have no further comment.” It’s not clear what investigation Ekeland was referring to. Last Friday, Canadian regulators launched an investigation into whether the company violates privacy laws in this country. “I think it is very questionable whether it would conform with Canadian law,” Michael McEvoy, British Columbia’s privacy commissioner, told the Star last week. After previously refusing to confirm whether it used Clearview AI, the RCMP released a statement Thursday saying it had done so for months. The RCMP’s statement said it was providing confirmation “in the interest of transparency.” The disclosure came a day after the Star approached the national police force for comment about data showing its extensive, paid use of the tool. According to the data obtained by BuzzFeed, officers have run more than 450 searches since last October. The Mounties’ statement comes after the force made a commitment to the federal privacy commissioner in late January, saying it would submit an assessment of potential privacy impacts before deploying facial recognition technology of any kind, according to a spokesperson for the watchdog’s office. “We were surprised by the RCMP’s news release today,” the spokesperson said Thursday. “In light of the RCMP’s acknowledgment of their use of Clearview’s facial recognition technology, we are launching an investigation. Given we are now investigating, no further details are available at this time.” The RCMP’s statement Thursday said its child exploitation investigations unit had two licences for the app, and investigators have used it in 15 cases, resulting in the successful identification and rescue of two children. The national police force also said that “a few units” tested the app in criminal investigations. Among the private businesses in the data obtained by BuzzFeed is Rexall, a pharmacy chain with 415 stores in Canada. A spokesperson for Rexall confirmed Thursday that the company’s “loss prevention unit” received a trial of the software from a contact at the Toronto Police Service. “During the trial period, an employee used the software to search approximately seven individuals who were suspected of shoplifting from Rexall stores,” spokesperson Andrew Forgione said. “No action was taken from the searches, and Rexall has discontinued use with no plans to reactivate,” Forgione said, adding that the trial ended 10 days ago. According to the data obtained by BuzzFeed, Toronto police was the most prolific user of the app in Canada, with more than 3,400 searches in recent months.

However, we can say that questions such as access and timing will be included in, and released in the findings of our review,” she said. The nearly three dozen Canadian police forces in the data obtained by BuzzFeed include services from British Columbia to Nova Scotia; Ontario has the most of any province, with 21. Nine police services that earlier in the week said they did not use Clearview AI subsequently confirmed they had done so after the Star asked why their members were listed in the data. Those services each said officers had signed for the technology without the force’s knowledge.

Ontario’s privacy commissioner demanded this month that all Ontario police forces stop using Clearview AI “immediately” and contact his office if they had. Via Rail said that its police “took advantage of a free trial service using some team members’ photos (with permission). They learned more about the technologies and methodologies involved, and assessed the service. They concluded over the course of our review to not pursue ongoing access to this technology.” A spokesperson the Insurance Bureau of Canada said that “our investigators were offered and took a demonstration of the product by Clearview AI. IBC chose not to move forward with the product.” A Halifax police spokesperson said: “We have looked into this further and found that a very limited number of specialized investigators have used this application very recently.” After learning about the data breach Thursday, “our use of the application has been suspended.” Kate Allen is a Toronto-based reporter covering science and technology.

Police tweeted just after 8:10 a.m. that the man was struck at Sherbourne Street and King Street East. The driver stayed at the scene. Toronto police confirmed in a tweet shortly after 3:30 p.m. that the victim was not on a streetcar and was “crossing at (a) signalized intersection against a red light.” At first, police said they received reports that the victim was stepping off a streetcar. But after further investigation, this was proven not to be the case, TTC spokesperson Stuart Green said. “We have an operator who witnessed the incident and is fully co-operating with police,” Green said in a tweet. The roads have been reopened. Update - Feb. 28, 2020: The article and headline was updated from a previously published version to include new information that the person who was injured was not leaving a TTC streetcar when he was struck by a driver. As well, the previous version mistakenly said the incident occurred at King St. West and Sherbourne Street. In fact, the incident occurred at King St. East and Sherbourne Street.

            "Toronto’s bloodiest year for gun violence is coming to a close. It started early on Jan. 1, 2019, when a man was shot at Oakwood Avenue and Vaughan Road. He was rushed to a trauma centre and survived. And the violence continued until the last day of the year, with a double shooting near Jane Street and Finch Avenue West in the early hours of New Year’s Eve, and another man shot and killed in the evening. The two victims of the first shooting, both men, were rushed to hospital in serious condition. The victim of the second died in hospital after being shot in Scarborough at Neilson Road and Crow Trail, near Finch Avenue East. As of 9 p.m. on New Year’s Eve, 292 people had been  killed or injured in shootings in the city, 56 more than the previous year, which itself set a record for the most people shot in police data that goes back 15 years. Despite a more than 20 per cent increase in the number of shootings compared to 2018, this year saw seven fewer people killed by guns. Experts say that the combined total of injuries and deaths is a better measure of overall gun violence than fatal shootings alone, in part because whether a victim lives or dies can be decided by factors like health care, time of day or random chance. In an emailed statement, Courtney Glen, a spokesperson for Mayor John Tory, said the mayor continues to work closely with Toronto police to address gun and gang violence in the city, including funding for more front line and neighbourhood police officers in 2020, as well as more investment in communities to address the roots of violence. Tory “will continue to advocate for investments from the province and federal governments, while also calling for much tougher bail and sentencing laws when it comes to gun crimes,” Glen said. She added that the mayor plans to bring together the mayors of GTA municipalities, police chiefs and representatives from the provincial and federal governments to discuss “what else we can do across our region to address gun violence.” At his year-end news conference, dominated by the topic of gun violence, Toronto police Chief Mark Saunders emphasized the city’s policing needs are growing increasingly complex. In 2020, Toronto police will continue an approach they adopted during Project Community Space, a $4.5-million anti-gun violence project that wrapped after 15 weeks in late November. The project saw an increase in officer presence in strategic areas leading to hundreds of arrests, but ultimately did not result in a reduction in shootings. Saunders in particular emphasized that more “strategic” enforcement during the project had led to significant gun seizures. In the past, police “would blanket communities with officers,” which he acknowledged was divisive among some residents. This time they relied more on the guns and gangs and intelligence units to be “a lot more surgical.” Saunders said the spike in gun violence is partially attributed to the drug trade, particularly around the highly addictive opioid fentanyl, which he said has been a “game changer.” The city and police also led a gun buyback program, resulting in the surrender of 3,100 firearms, including 2,300 handguns, according to the mayor’s office. Accounting for population growth, the rate of gun violence in 2019 far exceeded even 2005, which was dubbed “the year of the gun” amid a record 51 gun homicides, the same total as 2018, which also set the city’s record for the most overall homicides, at 96. Forty-three men and one woman have been killed in shootings in Toronto in 2019. They are: Aseel Yehya, 18, who was shot on Elmhurst Dr. near Redwater Dr. in Etobicoke on Jan. 9 after police said a dark-coloured vehicle approached him.
